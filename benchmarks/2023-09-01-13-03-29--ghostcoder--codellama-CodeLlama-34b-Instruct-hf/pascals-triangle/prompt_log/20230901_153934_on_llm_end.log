 The issue is that the `_compute_row` function is trying to access elements of the `row` list that do not exist. This is because the `row` list is initialized as an empty list, and then elements are added to it in the `for` loop. However, the `for` loop starts at index 0, so the first element that is added to the `row` list is at index 0, and the second element is added at index 1, and so on.

To fix this issue, you can initialize the `row` list with the first element set to 1, and then add the remaining elements in the `for` loop. Here's the updated code:
```pyton
def _compute_row(row_index):
    """
    Returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the value at a position in a row of Pascal's Triangle.
    """
    row = [1]
    for j in range(1, row_index + 1):
        row.append(row[j - 1] + row[j])
    return row
```
With this change, the tests should pass.
