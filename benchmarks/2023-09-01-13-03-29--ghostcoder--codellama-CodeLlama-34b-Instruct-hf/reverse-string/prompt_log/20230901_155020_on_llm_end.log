```pyton
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]

```

In this solution, I have implemented the `reverse` function using slicing. The `[::-1]` syntax reverses the string by starting from the end and moving backwards to the beginning.

Here's an example of how this function would be used:
```pyton
print(reverse("cool")) # Output: "looc"
```
This solution is concise and efficient, and it doesn't require any additional libraries or imports.
