# Instructions

Implement encoding and decoding for the rail fence cipher.

The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded.
It was already used by the ancient Greeks.

In the Rail Fence cipher, the message is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom (like a zig-zag).
Finally the message is then read off in rows.

For example, using three "rails" and the message "WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE", the cipherer writes out:

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .
```

Then reads off:

```text
WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN
```

To decrypt a message you take the zig-zag shape and fill the ciphertext along the rows.

```text
? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ?
. ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

The first row has seven spots that can be filled with "WECRLTE".

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

Now the 2nd row takes "ERDSOEEFEAOC".

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

Leaving "AIVDEN" for the last row.

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .
```

If you now read along the zig-zag shape you can read the original message.

def encode(message, rails):
    # Initialize the encoded message to an empty string
    encoded_message = ""

    # Loop through each rail
    for i in range(rails):
        # Add the message characters at the current rail position to the encoded message
        for j in range(i, len(message), rails):
            encoded_message += message[j]

    return encoded_message


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    # Initialize the decoded message to an empty string
    decoded_message = ""

    # Loop through each rail
    for i in range(rails):
        # Add the encoded message characters at the current rail position to the decoded message
        for j in range(i, len(encoded_message), rails):
            decoded_message += encoded_message[j]

    return decoded_message

```

Explanation:

In the `encode` function, we loop through each rail and add the message characters at the current rail position to the encoded message. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around to the beginning of the message when we reach the end.

In the `decode` function, we loop through each rail and add the encoded message characters at the current rail position to the decoded message. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around to the beginning of the encoded message when we reach the end.

Note that the `rails` parameter is used to determine the number of rails to use for the encoding and decoding. This allows us to use the same function for different numbers of rails.</s>
