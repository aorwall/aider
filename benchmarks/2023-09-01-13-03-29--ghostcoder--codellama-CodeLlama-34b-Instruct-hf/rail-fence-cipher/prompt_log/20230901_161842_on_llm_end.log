Explanation:

In the `encode` function, we loop through each rail and add the message characters at the current rail position to the encoded message. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around to the beginning of the message when we reach the end.

In the `decode` function, we loop through each rail and add the encoded message characters at the current rail position to the decoded message. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around to the beginning of the encoded message when we reach the end.

Note that the `rails` parameter is used to determine the number of rails to use for the encoding and decoding. This allows us to use the same function for different numbers of rails.
