 The issue is with the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `rail_fence_cipher.py` file. The tests are failing because the functions are not correctly implementing the rail fence cipher algorithm.

The `encode` function should take a message and a number of rails as input, and return the encoded message. The `decode` function should take an encoded message and a number of rails as input, and return the decoded message.

The rail fence cipher algorithm works by dividing the message into rows, where each row is a rail. The message is then encoded by writing the characters of the message along the rows, starting at the first rail and moving to the last rail, then back to the first rail, and so on.

For example, if the message is "EXERCISMISAWESOME" and the number of rails is 5, the encoded message would be "ESOCIMREEEIXSWMAS".

To fix the code, you will need to modify the `encode` and `decode` functions to correctly implement the rail fence cipher algorithm. You can use the tests to guide your implementation and ensure that the functions are working correctly.
