# Explanation

In this solution, we define a function `trinary` that takes a string representing a trinary number as input and returns its decimal equivalent.

We first check if the input string is a valid trinary number by calling the `is_valid_trinary` function. If the input string is not valid, we return 0 as the decimal equivalent.

If the input string is valid, we initialize the decimal equivalent to 0 and iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we get its integer value and calculate its decimal equivalent by multiplying its value with the base 3 value of the current place. We then add the decimal equivalent of the current character to the running total of the decimal equivalent.

After iterating through all characters in the input string, we return the final decimal equivalent.

The `is_valid_trinary` function checks if all characters in the input string are valid trinary digits (0, 1, or 2). We use the `all` function to check if all characters in the input string are valid trinary digits. If any character is not a valid trinary digit, the function returns `False`.

Note that we use the `len` function to get the length of the input string, and we subtract 1 from the length to get the current place value. This is because the last place in a trinary number is the 1's place, the second to last is the 3's place, and so on.
