This function calculates the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the Pythagorean theorem. Then, it determines the earned points based on the distance, using the rules provided in the instructions. If the distance is greater than 10, the points earned is 0. If the distance is greater than 5, the points earned is 1. If the distance is greater than 1, the points earned is 5. Otherwise, the points earned is 10.
