 The issue is that the `value` dictionary is not defined in the `lst` property. To fix this, you can define the `value` dictionary as a class attribute, like this:
```pyton
class Allergies:

    value = {
        "eggs": 1,
        "peanuts": 2,
        "shellfish": 4,
        "strawberries": 8,
        "tomatoes": 16,
        "chocolate": 32,
        "pollen": 64,
        "cats": 128
    }

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        return self.score & value[item]

    @property
    def lst(self):
        return [k for k, v in value.items() if self.score & v]
```
This way, the `value` dictionary is available to the `lst` property, and the tests should pass.
