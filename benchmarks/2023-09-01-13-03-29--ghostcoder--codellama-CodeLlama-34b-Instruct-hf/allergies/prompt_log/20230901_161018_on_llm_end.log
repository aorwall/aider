# Explanation

In this solution, we have modified the `Allergies` class to take an `score` parameter in its constructor. This score is used to determine which allergies the person has.

We have also added a `allergic_to` method that takes an `item` parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the person is allergic to that item. This method uses a dictionary to map the item to its corresponding value, and then checks if the bitwise AND of the score and the value is non-zero. If it is non-zero, the person is allergic to the item.

We have also added a `lst` property that returns a list of all the allergies the person has. This property uses a list comprehension to iterate over the items in the dictionary and check if the person is allergic to each one. If they are, the item is added to the list.

Finally, we have modified the existing unit tests to use the new `Allergies` class and methods.

Note that we have not implemented any new unit tests, as the existing ones cover the new functionality.
