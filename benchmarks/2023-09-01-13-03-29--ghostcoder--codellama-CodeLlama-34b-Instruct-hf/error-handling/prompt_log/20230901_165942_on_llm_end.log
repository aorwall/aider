 The errors in the testing output indicate that there are issues with the `handle_error_by_throwing_exception`, `handle_error_by_returning_none`, and `handle_error_by_returning_tuple` functions in the `error_handling.py` file.

Here are the specific issues:

1. `handle_error_by_throwing_exception`: The function is not raising an exception when it should. The test case is expecting an `Exception` to be raised, but it is not happening.
2. `handle_error_by_returning_none`: The function is not returning `None` when it should. The test case is expecting the function to return `None` when an invalid input is provided, but it is not happening.
3. `handle_error_by_returning_tuple`: The function is not returning a tuple with a `None` value when it should. The test case is expecting the function to return a tuple with a `None` value when an invalid input is provided, but it is not happening.

To resolve these issues, you should review the code in the `error_handling.py` file and make sure that it is correctly implementing the error handling strategies described in the test cases.
