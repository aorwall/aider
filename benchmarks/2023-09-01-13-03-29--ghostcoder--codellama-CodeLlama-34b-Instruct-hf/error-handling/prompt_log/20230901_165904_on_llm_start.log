Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
# Hints

For the `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception` function, the `filelike_object`
will be an instance of a custom `FileLike` class defined in the test suite. This
class implements the following methods:
- `open` and `close`, for explicit opening and closing.
- `__enter__` and `__exit__`, for implicit opening and closing.
- `do_something`, which may or may not throw an `Exception`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: error_handling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
