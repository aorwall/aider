def leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False

```

Explanation:

The function `leap_year` takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

The function first checks if the year is divisible by 4, if it is not, it returns `False`.

If the year is divisible by 4, it then checks if the year is also divisible by 100. If it is, it checks if the year is also divisible by 400. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

If the year is not divisible by 100, it returns `True`.

This implementation follows the rules provided in the instructions, which are based on the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years.
