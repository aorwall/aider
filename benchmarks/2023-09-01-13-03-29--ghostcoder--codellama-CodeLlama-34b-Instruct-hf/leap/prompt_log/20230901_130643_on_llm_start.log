<s>[INST]<<SYS>>
Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
[PYTHON]
# ... code 
[/PYTHON]

<</SYS>>

Filepath: leap.py

```python
def leap_year(year):
    pass

```

# Instructions

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.
1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

## Notes

Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
