If it is, it checks if the year is also divisible by 400. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nIf the year is not divisible by 100, it returns `True`.\n\nThis implementation follows the rules provided in the instructions, which are based on the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years.",
