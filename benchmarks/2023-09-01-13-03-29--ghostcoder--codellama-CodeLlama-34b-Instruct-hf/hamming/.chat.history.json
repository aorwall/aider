When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the strands being checked are not the same length. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# When the sequences being passed are not the same length.\nraise ValueError(\"Strands must be of equal length.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hamming.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

If they are not, a `ValueError` is raised with the message \"Strands must be of equal length.\" This ensures that the function only calculates the Hamming distance between two strands of equal length, as the distance is only defined for sequences of equal length.\n\nThe existing function stubs have been kept and updated to include the new check. The `distance` function now returns the sum of the number of positions at which the corresponding elements of the two strands are different. This is the Hamming distance between the two strands.\n\nThe unit tests have not been changed, as they will still test the functionality of the `distance` function.",
