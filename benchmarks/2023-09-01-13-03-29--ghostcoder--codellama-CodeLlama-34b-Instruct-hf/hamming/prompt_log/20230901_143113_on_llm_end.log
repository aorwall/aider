####

The updated code includes a check to ensure that the two strands being compared are of equal length. If they are not, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Strands must be of equal length." This ensures that the function only calculates the Hamming distance between two strands of equal length, as the distance is only defined for sequences of equal length.

The existing function stubs have been kept and updated to include the new check. The `distance` function now returns the sum of the number of positions at which the corresponding elements of the two strands are different. This is the Hamming distance between the two strands.

The unit tests have not been changed, as they will still test the functionality of the `distance` function.
