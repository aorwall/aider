 The issue is that the `legacy_data` dictionary contains integer values, but the `transform` function is trying to call the `lower()` method on them, which is not defined for integers.

To fix the issue, you can modify the `transform` function to only call the `lower()` method on the keys of the `legacy_data` dictionary, which are strings. Here's an updated version of the `transform` function that should work:
```
def transform(legacy_data):
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in legacy_data.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return new_data
```
With this updated `transform` function, the tests should now pass.
