# Introduction

You work for a company that makes an online multiplayer game called Lexiconia.

To play the game, each player is given 13 letters, which they must rearrange to create words.
Different letters have different point values, since it's easier to create words with some letters than others.

The game was originally launched in English, but it is very popular, and now the company wants to expand to other languages as well.

Different languages need to support different point values for letters.
The point values are determined by how often letters are used, compared to other letters in that language.

For example, the letter 'C' is quite common in English, and is only worth 3 points.
But in Norwegian it's a very rare letter, and is worth 10 points.

To make it easier to add new languages, your team needs to change the way letters and their point values are stored in the game.
# Instructions

Your task is to change the data format of letters and their point values in the game.

Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping.

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

This needs to be changed to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- etc.

As part of this change, the team has also decided to change the letters to be lower-case rather than upper-case.

If you want to look at how the data was previously structured and how it needs to change, take a look at the examples in the test suite.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: etl.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] To modify the data format of letters and their point values in the game, we need to change the way letters are stored in the game. Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping. We need to change this to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

Here's an example of how the data could be stored:


```python
letters = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 3,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 2,
    "e": 1,
    "f": 4,
    "g": 2,
    "h": 4,
    "i": 1,
    "j": 8,
    "k": 5,
    "l": 1,
    "m": 3,
    "n": 1,
    "o": 1,
    "p": 3,
    "q": 10,
    "r": 1,
    "s": 1,
    "t": 1,
    "u": 1,
    "v": 4,
    "w": 4,
    "x": 8,
    "y": 4,
    "z": 10
}
```

In this example, each letter is stored with its corresponding point value. The letters are stored in lower-case, as per the instructions.

To modify the `etl.py` file to use this new data format, we can update the `transform` function to use the new data structure. Here's an example of how the updated function could look:
I updated file with Filepath: etl.py
Filepath: etl.py
```
def transform(legacy_data):
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in legacy_data.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return new_data

```

In this example, we iterate over the items in the `legacy_data` dictionary, and for each item, we add a new key-value pair to the `new_data` dictionary. The key is the lower-case version of the letter, and the value is the score.

With this updated function, the `etl.py` file is now ready to use the new data format. The `transform` function will take the legacy data and convert it to the new format, which can then be used by the rest of the game.</s>

def transform(legacy_data):
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in legacy_data.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return new_data

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in etl.py to resolve the errors.
