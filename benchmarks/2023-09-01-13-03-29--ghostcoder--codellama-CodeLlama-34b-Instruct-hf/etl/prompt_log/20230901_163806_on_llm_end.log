 To modify the data format of letters and their point values in the game, we need to change the way letters are stored in the game. Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping. We need to change this to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

Here's an example of how the data could be stored:
```python
letters = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 3,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 2,
    "e": 1,
    "f": 4,
    "g": 2,
    "h": 4,
    "i": 1,
    "j": 8,
    "k": 5,
    "l": 1,
    "m": 3,
    "n": 1,
    "o": 1,
    "p": 3,
    "q": 10,
    "r": 1,
    "s": 1,
    "t": 1,
    "u": 1,
    "v": 4,
    "w": 4,
    "x": 8,
    "y": 4,
    "z": 10
}
```
In this example, each letter is stored with its corresponding point value. The letters are stored in lower-case, as per the instructions.

To modify the `etl.py` file to use this new data format, we can update the `transform` function to use the new data structure. Here's an example of how the updated function could look:
```python
def transform(legacy_data):
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in legacy_data.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return new_data
```
In this example, we iterate over the items in the `legacy_data` dictionary, and for each item, we add a new key-value pair to the `new_data` dictionary. The key is the lower-case version of the letter, and the value is the score.

With this updated function, the `etl.py` file is now ready to use the new data format. The `transform` function will take the legacy data and convert it to the new format, which can then be used by the rest of the game.
