 The errors in the test results indicate that the `Scale` class is not properly implemented. Specifically, the `chromatic` and `interval` methods are not returning the correct values.

To fix the errors, you need to implement the `chromatic` and `interval` methods correctly. Here's a possible implementation:
```pyton
class Scale:
    def __init__(self, tonic):
        self.tonic = tonic

    def chromatic(self):
        return [self.tonic + i for i in range(12)]

    def interval(self, intervals):
        scale = [self.tonic]
        for interval in intervals:
            scale.append(scale[-1] + interval)
        return scale
```
In the `chromatic` method, we use a list comprehension to generate a list of 12 notes starting from the tonic note.

In the `interval` method, we start with the tonic note and append each note in the `intervals` list to the `scale` list. The `interval` parameter is a string of intervals, where each interval is represented by a single character. We use the `+` operator to add the interval to the previous note to get the next note in the scale.

With this implementation, the test results should now pass.
