The Spaniard owns the dog.\n3. Coffee is drunk in the green house.\n4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.\n5. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.\n6. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.\n7. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.\n8. Milk is drunk in the middle house.\n9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.\n10. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.\n11. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.\n12. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.\n13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.\n14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can make the following deductions:\n\n1. The Englishman does not live in the green house, since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, and the Englishman lives in the red house.\n2. The Spaniard does not own the horse, since the horse is kept in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.\n3. The Ukrainian does not drink coffee, since coffee is drunk in the green house.\n4. The Norwegian does not live in the yellow house, since the Norwegian lives in the first house.\n5. The man who smokes Chesterfields does not live in the house next to the man with the fox, since the man with the fox lives in the house next to the man who smokes Chesterfields.\n6. The Lucky Strike smoker does not live in the house next to the house where the horse is kept, since the horse is kept in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.\n7. The Japanese does not live in the house next to the blue house, since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n\nNow, let's use the information we have gathered to determine who drinks water and who owns the zebra.\n\n1. The person who drinks water is the person who lives in the house next to the person who owns the zebra.\n2. The person who owns the zebra is the person who lives in the house next to the person who drinks water.\n\nUsing the information we have gathered, we can deduce that the Norwegian drinks water and owns the zebra.\n\nHere is the updated code:",
