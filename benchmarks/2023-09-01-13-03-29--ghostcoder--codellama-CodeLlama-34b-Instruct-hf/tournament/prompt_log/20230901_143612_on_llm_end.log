 As a helpful Senior Developer, I have reviewed the provided code and instructions for the football competition tallying program. Here's an updated version of the code that implements the required functionality:

Filepath: tournament.py

```python
def tally(rows):
    teams = {}
    for row in rows:
        team1, team2, outcome = row.split(';')
        if team1 not in teams:
            teams[team1] = {
                'MP': 0,
                'W': 0,
                'D': 0,
                'L': 0,
                'P': 0
            }
        if team2 not in teams:
            teams[team2] = {
                'MP': 0,
                'W': 0,
                'D': 0,
                'L': 0,
                'P': 0
            }
        teams[team1]['MP'] += 1
        teams[team2]['MP'] += 1
        if outcome == 'win':
            teams[team1]['W'] += 1
            teams[team2]['L'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 3
            teams[team2]['P'] += 0
        elif outcome == 'draw':
            teams[team1]['D'] += 1
            teams[team2]['D'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 1
            teams[team2]['P'] += 1
        else:
            teams[team1]['L'] += 1
            teams[team2]['W'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 0
            teams[team2]['P'] += 3
    return teams

```

In this updated version, I have implemented the `tally` function that takes a list of rows as input, where each row is a string containing the two teams and the outcome of their match. The function then creates a dictionary called `teams` that stores the tally for each team, with the team name as the key and a dictionary of their tally as the value.

The function then iterates over each row in the input list, splits the row into the two teams and the outcome, and updates the tally for each team accordingly. The tally includes the number of matches played (`MP`), won (`W`), drawn (`D`), lost (`L`), and points (`P`).

Finally, the function returns the `teams` dictionary.

Note that I have kept the existing function and class stubs in the code, as requested in the instructions. I have also implemented the required functionality without suggesting any additional packages or libraries.
