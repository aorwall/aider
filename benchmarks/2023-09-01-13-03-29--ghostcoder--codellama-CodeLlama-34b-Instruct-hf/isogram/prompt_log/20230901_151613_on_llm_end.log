 The issue with the code in `isogram.py` is that it is not properly handling the case where the input string contains duplicate characters, including hyphens.

To fix this, you can modify the code to use a regular expression to remove any duplicate characters, including hyphens, before checking if the string is an isogram. Here's an updated version of the code:
```pyton
import re

def is_isogram(string):
    # Remove any duplicate characters, including hyphens
    string = re.sub(r'(\w)\1+', '', string)
    return len(string) == len(set(string.lower()))
```
With this updated code, the tests should now pass.
