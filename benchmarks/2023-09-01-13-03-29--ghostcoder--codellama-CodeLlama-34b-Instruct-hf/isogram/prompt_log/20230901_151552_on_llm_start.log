# Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```
def is_isogram(string):
    return len(string) == len(set(string.lower()))
```

In this implementation, we use the `set` data structure to keep track of the unique letters in the input string. We convert the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure that capital letters are not treated as unique letters.

We then compare the length of the input string to the length of the set of unique letters. If the lengths are the same, then the input string is an isogram.

Here's an example usage of the function:


```None
print(is_isogram("lumberjacks")) # True
print(is_isogram("background")) # True
print(is_isogram("downstream")) # True
print(is_isogram("six-year-old")) # True
print(is_isogram("isograms")) # False
```

Note that the function will return `False` for any input that contains repeating letters, regardless of whether they are separated by spaces or hyphens.</s>
