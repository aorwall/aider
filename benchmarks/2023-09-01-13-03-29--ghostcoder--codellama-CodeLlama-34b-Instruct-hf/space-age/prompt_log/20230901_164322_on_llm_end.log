 Here is the updated code for the `space_age.py` file:
```
class SpaceAge:
    def __init__(self, seconds):
        self.seconds = seconds

    def on_mercury(self):
        return self.seconds / 0.2408467

    def on_venus(self):
        return self.seconds / 0.61519726

    def on_earth(self):
        return self.seconds / 1.0

    def on_mars(self):
        return self.seconds / 1.8808158

    def on_jupiter(self):
        return self.seconds / 11.862615

    def on_saturn(self):
        return self.seconds / 29.447498

    def on_uranus(self):
        return self.seconds / 84.016846

    def on_neptune(self):
        return self.seconds / 164.79132
```
Explanation:

* I have added the `on_mercury`, `on_venus`, `on_earth`, `on_mars`, `on_jupiter`, `on_saturn`, `on_uranus`, and `on_neptune` methods to the `SpaceAge` class. These methods calculate the age on each planet based on the orbital period of the planet.
* I have used the orbital periods provided in the instructions to calculate the age on each planet.
* I have kept the existing function or class stubs and implemented them as per the instructions.
* I have not implemented or changed any unit tests.
* I have only used standard python libraries and have not suggested installing any packages.

Note: The orbital periods used in the code are the average orbital periods of the planets and are not the exact orbital periods.
