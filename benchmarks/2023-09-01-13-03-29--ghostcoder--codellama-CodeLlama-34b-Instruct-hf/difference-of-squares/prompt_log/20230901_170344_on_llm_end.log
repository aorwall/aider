```pyton
def square_of_sum(number):
    return sum(range(1, number+1))**2


def sum_of_squares(number):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(1, number+1))


def difference_of_squares(number):
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number)

```

Explanation:

* The `square_of_sum` function has been implemented using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
* The `sum_of_squares` function has been implemented using a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to `number`.
* The `difference_of_squares` function has been implemented by calling the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions and subtracting their results.

Note: The above implementation is a simple and straightforward solution to the problem. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for large values of `number`.
