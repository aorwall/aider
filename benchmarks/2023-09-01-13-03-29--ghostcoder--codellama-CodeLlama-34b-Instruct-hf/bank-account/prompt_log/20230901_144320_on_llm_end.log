The changes made to the `BankAccount` class include:

1. Adding a `lock` attribute to the class, which is a `threading.Lock` object that will be used to synchronize access to the account.
2. Adding a `is_open` attribute to the class, which is a boolean that indicates whether the account is open or closed.
3. Adding a `open` method to the class, which sets the `is_open` attribute to `True` and raises a `ValueError` if the account is already open.
4. Adding a `close` method to the class, which sets the `is_open` attribute to `False` and raises a `ValueError` if the account is not open.
5. Adding a `deposit` method to the class, which adds the specified amount to the account balance and raises a `ValueError` if the amount is less than or equal to 0.
6. Adding a `withdraw` method to the class, which subtracts the specified amount from the account balance and raises a `ValueError` if the amount is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the account balance.
7. Adding a `get_balance` method to the class, which returns the current account balance and raises a `ValueError` if the account is not open.

The `lock` attribute is used to synchronize access to the account, ensuring that only one thread can access the account at a time. This is necessary because the account can be accessed from multiple threads/processes, as specified in the instructions.

The `is_open` attribute is used to indicate whether the account is open or closed, and is used to raise a `ValueError` if an operation is attempted on a closed account.

The `open` and `close` methods are used to open and close the account, respectively. These methods raise a `ValueError` if the account is already open or not open, respectively.

The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods are used to deposit and withdraw money from the account, respectively. These methods raise a `ValueError` if the amount is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the account balance, respectively.

The `get_balance` method is used to get the current account balance, and raises a `ValueError` if the account is not open.

The updated code should now be able to handle multiple threads/processes accessing the account simultaneously, and should raise appropriate errors if an operation is attempted on a closed account or if the amount is invalid.
