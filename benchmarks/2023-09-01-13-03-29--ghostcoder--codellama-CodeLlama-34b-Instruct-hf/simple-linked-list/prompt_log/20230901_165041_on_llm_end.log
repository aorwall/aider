# Introduction

You work for a music streaming company.

You've been tasked with creating a playlist feature for your music player application.
# Instructions

Write a prototype of the music player application.

For the prototype, each song will simply be represented by a number.
Given a range of numbers (the song IDs), create a singly linked list.

Given a singly linked list, you should be able to reverse the list to play the songs in the opposite order.

~~~~exercism/note
The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.

The simplest kind of linked list is a **singly** linked list.
That means that each element (or "node") contains data, along with something that points to the next node in the list.

If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.

## How this Exercise is Structured in Python

While `stacks` and `queues` can be implemented using `lists`, `collections.deque`, `queue.LifoQueue`, and `multiprocessing.Queue`, this exercise expects a ["Last in, First Out" (`LIFO`) stack][Baeldung: The Stack Data Structure] (_interactive example [here][LIFO Stack]_) using a _custom-made_ [singly linked list][singly linked list].

![Diagram representing a stack implemented with a linked list. A circle with a dashed border named New_Node is to the far left-hand side, with two dotted arrow lines pointing right-ward.  New_Node reads "(becomes head) - New_Node - next = node_6". The top dotted arrow line is labeled "push" and points to Node_6, above and to the right.  Node_6 reads "(current) head - Node_6 - next = node_5". The bottom dotted arrow line is labeled "pop" and points to a box that reads "gets removed on pop()". Node_6 has a solid arrow that points rightward to Node_5, which reads "Node_5 - next = node_4". Node_5 has a solid arrow pointing
