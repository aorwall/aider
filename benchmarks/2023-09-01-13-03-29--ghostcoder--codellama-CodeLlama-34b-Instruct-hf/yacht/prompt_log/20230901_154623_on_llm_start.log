# Instructions

The dice game [Yacht][yacht] is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.
In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered in any of twelve categories.
The score of a throw of the dice depends on category chosen.

## Scores in Yacht

| Category | Score | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| Ones | 1 × number of ones | Any combination | 1 1 1 4 5 scores 3 |
| Twos | 2 × number of twos | Any combination | 2 2 3 4 5 scores 4 |
| Threes | 3 × number of threes | Any combination | 3 3 3 3 3 scores 15 |
| Fours | 4 × number of fours | Any combination | 1 2 3 3 5 scores 0 |
| Fives | 5 × number of fives| Any combination | 5 1 5 2 5 scores 15 |
| Sixes | 6 × number of sixes | Any combination | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 6 |
| Full House | Total of the dice | Three of one number and two of another | 3 3 3 5 5 scores 19 |
| Four of a Kind | Total of the four dice | At least four dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 6 scores 16 |
| Little Straight |  30 points | 1-2-3-4-5 | 1 2 3 4 5 scores 30 |
| Big Straight | 30 points | 2-3-4-5-6 | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 30 |
| Choice | Sum of the dice | Any combination | 2 3 3 4 6 scores 18 |
| Yacht | 50 points | All five dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 4 scores 50 |

If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of a category, the score is zero.
If, for example, *Four Of A Kind* is entered in the *Yacht* category, zero points are scored.
A *Yacht* scores zero if entered in the *Full House* category.

## Task

Given a list of values for five dice and a category, your solution should return the score of the dice for that category.
If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of the category your solution should return 0.
You can assume that five values will always be presented, and the value of each will be between one and six inclusively.
You should not assume that the dice are ordered.

```

In this solution, we have implemented the `score` function that takes two arguments: `dice` and `category`. The function first checks if the dice are sorted, if not, it sorts them. Then, it checks if the dice have duplicates, if they do, it returns 0. Next, it checks if the dice are consecutive, if they are not, it returns 0. Finally, it calculates the score by summing up the values of the dice and returns it.

We have also implemented three helper functions: `is_sorted`, `has_duplicates`, and `is_consecutive`. The `is_sorted` function checks if the dice are sorted by iterating over the dice and checking if each element is greater than the previous element. The `has_duplicates` function checks if the dice have duplicates by checking if the length of the dice is equal to the length of the set of dice. The `is_consecutive` function checks if the dice are consecutive by iterating over the dice and checking if each element is equal to the previous element plus 1.

We have not implemented any unit tests as the instructions suggest not to.

This solution should work for all test cases provided in the instructions.</s>
