 The issue with the code is that it is not handling the case where the input list contains consecutive null values at the front of the list. In this case, the code is returning a list with the null values included, when it should be omitting them from the final result.

To fix this issue, you can modify the code to check if the first element of the input list is null, and if so, skip over it and continue processing the rest of the list. Here is an updated version of the code that should pass all the tests:
```
def flatten(iterable):
    result = []
    for item in iterable:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            result.extend(flatten(item))
        else:
            if item is not None:
                result.append(item)
    return result
```
This code checks if the first element of the input list is null, and if so, skips over it and continues processing the rest of the list. If the first element is not null, it is appended to the result list.

With this updated code, the tests should now pass.
