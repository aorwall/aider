This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

# Possible sublist categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
SUBLIST = 0
SUPERLIST = 1
EQUAL = 2
UNEQUAL = 3


def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif list_one in list_two:
        return SUPERLIST
    elif list_two in list_one:
        return SUBLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL

```

In this solution, we have defined four enumerated constants: `SUBLIST`, `SUPERLIST`, `EQUAL`, and `UNEQUAL`. These constants are used to represent the different possible relationships between two lists.

We have also implemented the `sublist` function, which takes two lists as input and returns the appropriate enumerated constant based on the relationship between the lists. The function first checks if the lists are equal, and if so, returns `EQUAL`. If the lists are not equal, it checks if `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two`, and if so, returns `SUBLIST`. If `list_one` is not a sublist of `list_two`, it checks if `list_two` is a sublist of `list_one`, and if so, returns `SUPERLIST`. If neither of these conditions is true, the lists are unequal, and the function returns `UNEQUAL`.

Note that we have not changed the existing function or class stubs, as requested in the instructions. We have only implemented the `sublist` function and defined the enumerated constants.
