 The issue with the code is that the enumerated constants are not being used correctly in the `sublist` function. The function is returning the wrong values for the different cases.

To fix the issue, we need to change the `sublist` function to use the enumerated constants correctly. Here's the corrected code:
```pyton
def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif list_one in list_two:
        return SUBLIST
    elif list_two in list_one:
        return SUPERLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
```
In this corrected code, we're using the enumerated constants correctly in the `sublist` function. We're returning `EQUAL` if the lists are equal, `SUBLIST` if `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two`, `SUPERLIST` if `list_two` is a sublist of `list_one`, and `UNEQUAL` if the lists are not equal.

With this corrected code, all the tests should pass.
