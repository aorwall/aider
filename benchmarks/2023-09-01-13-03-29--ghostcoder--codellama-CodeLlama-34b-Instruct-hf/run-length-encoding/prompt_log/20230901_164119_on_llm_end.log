 The issue is that the `decode` and `encode` functions are not implemented in the `run_length_encoding.py` file.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `decode` and `encode` functions in the `run_length_encoding.py` file.

Here is an example implementation of the `decode` function:
```
def decode(string):
    result = ""
    i = 0
    while i < len(string):
        if string[i].isdigit():
            count = int(string[i])
            result += string[i+1] * count
            i += 2
        else:
            result += string[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```
And here is an example implementation of the `encode` function:
```
def encode(string):
    result = ""
    i = 0
    while i < len(string):
        count = 1
        while i + count < len(string) and string[i] == string[i + count]:
            count += 1
        result += str(count) + string[i]
        i += count
    return result
```
With these implementations, the tests should pass.
