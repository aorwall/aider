# Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

[/INST] I updated a file. 
Filepath: triangle.py

```python
def equilateral(sides):
    if len(sides) != 3:
        return False
    if sides[0] == sides[1] == sides[2]:
        return True
    return False


def isosceles(sides):
    if len(sides) != 3:
        return False
    if sides[0] == sides[1] or sides[1] == sides[2] or sides[2] == sides[0]:
        return True
    return False


def scalene(sides):
    if len(sides) != 3:
        return False
    if sides[0] != sides[1] and sides[1] != sides[2] and sides[2] != sides[0]:
        return True
    return False

```

Explanation:

* I have updated the `equilateral`, `isosceles`, and `scalene` functions to check if the input `sides` list has a length of 3, and if not, return `False`. This is because the triangle inequality requires that all sides have a length greater than 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.
* I have also updated the `equilateral` function to check if all three sides are equal, and if so, return `True`.
* I have updated the `isosceles` function to check if at least two sides are equal, and if so, return `True`.
* I have updated the `scalene` function to check if all sides are different, and if so, return `True`.
* I have kept the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
* I have not implemented or changed any unit tests.
* I have only used standard python libraries, I have not suggested installing any packages.</s>
