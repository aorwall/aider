 The issue with the code is that it is not properly handling the case where the input text contains punctuation or special characters. The `calculate_chunk` function is only checking for letters, and is not accounting for other characters.

To fix this, you can modify the `calculate_chunk` function to use the `string.punctuation` module to remove any punctuation or special characters from the input text before calculating the letter frequencies. Here's an updated version of the `calculate_chunk` function that should work:
```python
import string

def calculate_chunk(chunk):
    # Remove punctuation and special characters from the input text
    chunk = chunk.translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))

    # Calculate the frequency of each letter in the chunk
    frequency = {}
    for letter in chunk:
        if letter not in frequency:
            frequency[letter] = 0
        frequency[letter] += 1
    return frequency
```
With this updated `calculate_chunk` function, the tests should now pass.
