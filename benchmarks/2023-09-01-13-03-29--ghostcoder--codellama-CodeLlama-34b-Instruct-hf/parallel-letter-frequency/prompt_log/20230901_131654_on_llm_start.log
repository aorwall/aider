# Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I updated a file.

```python
import multiprocessing as mp
def calculate(text_input):
    # Create a process pool with the number of CPU cores
    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count())

    # Split the input text into chunks
    chunks = [text_input[i::mp.cpu_count()] for i in range(mp.cpu_count())]

    # Map the chunks to the frequency calculation function
    results = pool.map(calculate_chunk, chunks)

    # Reduce the results to a single dictionary
    total_frequency = {}
    for result in results:
        for letter, frequency in result.items():
            if letter not in total_frequency:
                total_frequency[letter] = 0
            total_frequency[letter] += frequency

    return total_frequency

def calculate_chunk(chunk):
    # Calculate the frequency of each letter in the chunk
    frequency = {}
    for letter in chunk:
        if letter not in frequency:
            frequency[letter] = 0
        frequency[letter] += 1
    return frequency

```

In this updated version of the code, we have added parallelism using the `multiprocessing` library. We first create a process pool with the number of CPU cores, and then split the input text into chunks based on the number of CPU cores. We then map the chunks to the `calculate_chunk` function, which calculates the frequency of each letter in the chunk. Finally, we reduce the results to a single dictionary using the `total_frequency` variable.

Note that we have also added a new function called `calculate_chunk`, which calculates the frequency of each letter in a given chunk. This function is called by the `calculate` function and is responsible for the actual calculation of the letter frequencies.</s>

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in parallel_letter_frequency.py to resolve the errors.
