 The issue is that the `color_code` and `colors` functions are not implemented in `resistor_color.py`.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the functions as follows:
```pyton
def color_code(color):
    colors = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    return colors[color]

def colors():
    return list(colors.keys())
```
With these implementations, the tests should pass.
