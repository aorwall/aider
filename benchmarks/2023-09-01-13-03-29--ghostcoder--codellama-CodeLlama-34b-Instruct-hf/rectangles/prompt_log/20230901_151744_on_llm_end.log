prompt:
 The error message indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in the `rectangles_test.py` file. Specifically, it says that it cannot import the name `rectangles` from the `rectangles` module.

To fix this error, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that the `rectangles.py` file is in the same directory as the `rectangles_test.py` file.
2. Check that the `rectangles.py` file has the correct name and is in the correct location.
3. Make sure that the `rectangles.py` file is not empty and contains the necessary code.
4. Check that the `rectangles.py` file is not corrupted or damaged in some way.
5. Try renaming the `rectangles.py` file to something else and see if the error persists.
6. Try running the tests again after restarting the Python interpreter.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more information or context about your code and setup in order to troubleshoot the problem further.
