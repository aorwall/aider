```pyton
def count_rectangles(diagram):
    rectangles = 0
    for i in range(len(diagram)):
        for j in range(len(diagram[i])):
            if diagram[i][j] == "+":
                rectangles += 1
    return rectangles

```

Explanation:

* The function `count_rectangles` takes a string `diagram` as input, which represents the ASCII diagram.
* The function loops through each character in the diagram using nested for loops.
* If the current character is a plus sign (`+`), it increments the `rectangles` counter.
* The function returns the `rectangles` counter at the end.

Note: The above implementation assumes that the input diagram is a proper rectangle, meaning that the length of every line is equal to the length of the first line. If this assumption is not true, the function may not work correctly.
