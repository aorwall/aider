Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file

# Instructions

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains these 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text


   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text


+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text

  ++
  ++


```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of every line equals the length of the first line).

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rectangles.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I updated file with Filepath: rectangles.py

def count_rectangles(diagram):
    rectangles = 0
    for i in range(len(diagram)):
        for j in range(len(diagram[i])):
            if diagram[i][j] == "+":
                rectangles += 1
    return rectangles
```

Explanation:

* The function `count_rectangles` takes a string `diagram` as input, which represents the ASCII diagram.
* The function loops through each character in the diagram using nested for loops.
* If the current character is a plus sign (`+`), it increments the `rectangles` counter.
* The function returns the `rectangles` counter at the end.

Note: The above implementation assumes that the input diagram is a proper rectangle, meaning that the length of every line is equal to the length of the first line. If this assumption is not true, the function may not work correctly.</s>
