# Instructions

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.
It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write "the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.
You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

## Python Special Instructions

A third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.
raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Hangman Game

The Hangman game is a word guessing game. The player has to guess a word by suggesting letters. For each letter that is not in the word, they lose a life. If they guess all the letters in the word before losing all their lives, they win.

### Functional Reactive Programming

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that treats the program as a stream of events. In FRP, the program is a continuous flow of events, and the output is a function of the input.

In the context of the Hangman game, FRP can be used to represent the game state as a function of the player's guesses. The game state is the current state of the game, including the word, the number of remaining guesses, and the status of the game (win, lose, or ongoing).

### Implementing Hangman in FRP

To implement Hangman in FRP, we need to define the game state as a function of the player's guesses. We can do this by creating a stream of guesses and a stream of game states. The game state stream is the output of the function, and it is a function of the guess stream.

Here's an example of how to implement Hangman in FRP using the `rx` library in Python:
```

python
import rx

# Define the game state as a function of the player's guesses
def hangman(guesses):
    # Initialize the game state
    state = {
        'word': 'hangman',
        'remaining_guesses': 9,
        'status': 'ongoing'
    }

    # Create a stream of guesses
    guess_stream = rx.from_iterable(guesses)

    # Create a stream of game states
    state_stream = rx.from_iterable(state)

    # Define the game logic
    def game_logic(guess):
        # If the guess is in the word, reveal the letter
        if guess in state['word']:
            state['word'] = state['word'].replace(guess, '*')

        # If the guess is not in the word, decrement the remaining guesses
        else:
            state['remaining_guesses'] -= 1

        # If the player has won or lost, update the status
        if state['remaining_guesses'] == 0:
            state['status'] = 'lose'
        elif state['word'] == '':
            state['status'] = 'win'

        # Return the updated game state
        return state

    # Apply the game logic to the guess stream
    state_stream = guess_stream.map(game_logic)

    # Return the game state stream
    return state_stream

# Test the function
hangman(['h', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'm', 'a', 'n'])
```
In this example, we define the game state as a dictionary</s>
