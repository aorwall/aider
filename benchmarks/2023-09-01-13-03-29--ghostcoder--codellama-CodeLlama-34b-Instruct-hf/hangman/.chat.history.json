Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.\n\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.\nraise ValueError(\"The game has already ended.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

For each letter that is not in the word, they lose a life. If they guess all the letters in the word before losing all their lives, they win.\n\n### Functional Reactive Programming\n\nFunctional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that treats the program as a stream of events. In FRP, the program is a continuous flow of events, and the output is a function of the input.\n\nIn the context of the Hangman game, FRP can be used to represent the game state as a function of the player's guesses. The game state is the current state of the game, including the word, the number of remaining guesses, and the status of the game (win, lose, or ongoing).\n\n### Implementing Hangman in FRP\n\nTo implement Hangman in FRP, we need to define the game state as a function of the player's guesses. We can do this by creating a stream of guesses and a stream of game states. The game state stream is the output of the function, and it is a function of the guess stream.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement Hangman in FRP using the `rx` library in Python:\n```\n",
