DO YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe ordering of the word counts in the results doesn't matter.\n\nHere's an example that incorporates several of the elements discussed above:\n\n- simple words\n- contractions\n- numbers\n- case insensitive words\n- punctuation (including apostrophes) to separate words\n- different forms of whitespace to separate words\n\n`\"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!\", cried the Special Agent.\\nSo I fled.`\n\nThe mapping for this subtitle would be:\n\n```text\n123: 1\nagent: 1\ncried: 1\nfled: 1\ni: 1\npassword: 2\nso: 1\nspecial: 1\nthat's: 1\nthe: 2\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_count.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

The updated file includes the following changes:\n\n1. The `count_words` function has been updated to use a regular expression to split the subtitle into individual words. The regular expression `\\W+` is used to split the subtitle into words, where `\\W` matches any non-word character (i.e. any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore).\n2. The `count_words` function now uses a dictionary to keep track of the number of times each word occurs in the subtitle. The dictionary is initialized with the words from the subtitle as keys, and the values are set to 1 for each word.\n3. The `count_words` function now returns the dictionary of word counts.\n\nHere is the updated `word_count.py` file:",
