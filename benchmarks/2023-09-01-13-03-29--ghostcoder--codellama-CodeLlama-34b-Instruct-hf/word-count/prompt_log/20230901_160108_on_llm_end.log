 The issue with the code is that the `count_words` function is not implemented. The function is defined, but it does not contain any code to count the words in a sentence.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the function to count the words in a sentence. Here's an example implementation:
```pyton
def count_words(sentence):
    word_count = {}
    for word in sentence.split():
        if word not in word_count:
            word_count[word] = 1
        else:
            word_count[word] += 1
    return word_count
```
This implementation uses the `split()` method to split the sentence into individual words, and then iterates over the words using a `for` loop. For each word, it checks if the word is already in the `word_count` dictionary. If it is not, it adds the word to the dictionary with a count of 1. If it is, it increments the count for that word. Finally, it returns the `word_count` dictionary.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
