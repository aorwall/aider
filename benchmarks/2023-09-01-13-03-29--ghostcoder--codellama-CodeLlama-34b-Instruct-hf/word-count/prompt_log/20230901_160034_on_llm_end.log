 I have updated the `word_count.py` file to include the functionality to count the number of times each word occurs in a subtitle of a drama. The updated file includes the following changes:

1. The `count_words` function has been updated to use a regular expression to split the subtitle into individual words. The regular expression `\W+` is used to split the subtitle into words, where `\W` matches any non-word character (i.e. any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore).
2. The `count_words` function now uses a dictionary to keep track of the number of times each word occurs in the subtitle. The dictionary is initialized with the words from the subtitle as keys, and the values are set to 1 for each word.
3. The `count_words` function now returns the dictionary of word counts.

Here is the updated `word_count.py` file:
```
def count_words(subtitle):
    words = re.split(r'\W+', subtitle)
    word_counts = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] = 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] += 1
    return word_counts
```
I have also added a new file, `test_word_count.py`, which includes unit tests for the `count_words` function. The tests use the `unittest` module to define test cases and assert that the `count_words` function returns the expected results.

Here is the updated `test_word_count.py` file:
```
import unittest
from word_count import count_words

class TestWordCount(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_count_words(self):
        subtitle = "That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.\nSo I fled."
        expected_word_counts = {
            "123": 1,
            "agent": 1,
            "cried": 1,
            "fled": 1,
            "i": 1,
            "password": 2,
            "so": 1,
            "special": 1,
            "that's": 1,
            "the": 2
        }
        self.assertEqual(count_words(subtitle), expected_word_counts)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
