Be that way!\"**\n  This is how he responds to silence.\n  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.\n- **\"Whatever.\"**\n  This is what he answers to anything else.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

The existing function or class stubs were to be kept and implemented, and the unit tests were to be used to test the functionality.\n\nThe `response` function takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the following conditions:\n\n* If the input is all uppercase, return \"Whoa, chill out!\"\n* If the input ends with a question mark, return \"Sure.\"\n* If the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters, return \"Fine. Be that way!\"\n* Otherwise, return \"Whatever.\"\n\nThe changes made to the `bob.py` file include:\n\n* Adding a new function `response` that takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the conditions mentioned above.\n* Using the `isupper()` method to check if the input is all uppercase.\n* Using the `endswith()` method to check if the input ends with a question mark.\n* Using the `strip()` method to check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters.\n* Returning the appropriate response based on the conditions.\n\nThe updated `bob.py` file now includes the `response` function and can be used to respond to different inputs as per the conditions mentioned above.",
