# Explanation

In this task, we were asked to modify the `bob.py` file to make it respond to different inputs. The existing function or class stubs were to be kept and implemented, and the unit tests were to be used to test the functionality.

The `response` function takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the following conditions:

* If the input is all uppercase, return "Whoa, chill out!"
* If the input ends with a question mark, return "Sure."
* If the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters, return "Fine. Be that way!"
* Otherwise, return "Whatever."

The changes made to the `bob.py` file include:

* Adding a new function `response` that takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the conditions mentioned above.
* Using the `isupper()` method to check if the input is all uppercase.
* Using the `endswith()` method to check if the input ends with a question mark.
* Using the `strip()` method to check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters.
* Returning the appropriate response based on the conditions.

The updated `bob.py` file now includes the `response` function and can be used to respond to different inputs as per the conditions mentioned above.
