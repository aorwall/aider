Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Introduction

Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.
He likes to think that he's very cool.
And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.
That wouldn't be cool.

When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.isupper():
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Sure."
    elif hey_bob.strip() == "":
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."

```

# Explanation

In this task, we were asked to modify the `bob.py` file to make it respond to different inputs. The existing function or class stubs were to be kept and implemented, and the unit tests were to be used to test the functionality.

The `response` function takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the following conditions:

* If the input is all uppercase, return "Whoa, chill out!"
* If the input ends with a question mark, return "Sure."
* If the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters, return "Fine. Be that way!"
* Otherwise, return "Whatever."

The changes made to the `bob.py` file include:

* Adding a new function `response` that takes a string input `hey_bob` and returns a string output based on the conditions mentioned above.
* Using the `isupper()` method to check if the input is all uppercase.
* Using the `endswith()` method to check if the input ends with a question mark.
* Using the `strip()` method to check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters.
* Returning the appropriate response based on the conditions.

The updated `bob.py` file now includes the `response` function and can be used to respond to different inputs as per the conditions mentioned above.</s>
