 The issue is that the `Book` class is not defined in the `book_store.py` file, so the `book.price` attribute is not available.

To fix the issue, you need to define the `Book` class in the `book_store.py` file. Here's an example of how you can do that:
```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
```
With this change, the `Book` class is defined and the `book.price` attribute is available. The tests should now pass.
