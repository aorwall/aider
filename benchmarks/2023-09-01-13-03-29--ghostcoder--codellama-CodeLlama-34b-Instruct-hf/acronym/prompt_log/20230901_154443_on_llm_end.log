```pyton
def abbreviate(words):
    """
    Convert a phrase to its acronym.

    Args:
        words (str): The phrase to convert.

    Returns:
        str: The acronym of the phrase.
    """
    # Remove punctuation
    words = words.replace("-", " ").strip()

    # Extract the first letter of each word
    acronym = ""
    for word in words.split():
        acronym += word[0]

    return acronym.upper()

```

Explanation:

* I have updated the `abbreviate` function to remove punctuation from the input string using the `replace` method and the `strip` method.
* I have then extracted the first letter of each word in the input string using a for loop and the `split` method.
* I have concatenated the extracted letters to form the acronym using the `+=` operator.
* I have converted the acronym to uppercase using the `upper` method.
* I have added a docstring to the function to provide a description of what the function does and its parameters and return value.

Note: I have not changed the existing function or class stubs, as per the instructions.
