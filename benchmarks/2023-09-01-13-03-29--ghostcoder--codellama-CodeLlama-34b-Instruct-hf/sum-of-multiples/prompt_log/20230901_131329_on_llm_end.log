```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all the unique multiples of the given factors
    that are less than the limit.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the multiples
    multiples_list = []

    # Iterate over the factors and calculate the multiples
    for factor in multiples:
        # Calculate the multiples of the current factor
        multiples_of_factor = [i * factor for i in range(1, limit // factor + 1)]

        # Add the multiples to the list
        multiples_list.extend(multiples_of_factor)

    # Remove duplicates from the list
    unique_multiples = list(set(multiples_list))

    # Calculate the sum of the unique multiples
    sum_of_multiples = sum(unique_multiples)

    return sum_of_multiples
```

In this implementation, we first initialize an empty list to store the multiples. We then iterate over the factors and calculate the multiples of each factor using a list comprehension. We then add the multiples to the list and remove duplicates using a set. Finally, we calculate the sum of the unique multiples and return it.

Note that we have made the following assumptions:

* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers including zero.
* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique and sorted in ascending order.

These assumptions are based on the instructions provided in the problem statement.
