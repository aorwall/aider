# Introduction

You work for a company that makes an online, fantasy-survival game.

When a player finishes a level, they are awarded energy points.
The amount of energy awarded depends on which magical items the player found while exploring that level.
# Instructions

Your task is to write the code that calculates the energy points that get awarded to players when they complete a level.

The points awarded depend on two things:

- The level (a number) that the player completed.
- The base value of each magical item collected by the player during that level.

The energy points are awarded according to the following rules:

1. For each magical item, take the base value and find all the multiples of that value that are less than the level number.
2. Combine the sets of numbers.
3. Remove any duplicates.
4. Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.

Let's look at an example:

**The player completed level 20 and found two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.**

To calculate the energy points earned by the player, we need to find all the unique multiples of these base values that are less than level 20.

- Multiples of 3 less than 20: `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}`
- Multiples of 5 less than 20: `{5, 10, 15}`
- Combine the sets and remove duplicates: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18}`
- Sum the unique multiples: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`
- Therefore, the player earns **78** energy points for completing level 20 and finding the two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.
# Instructions append

You can make the following assumptions about the inputs to the
`sum_of_multiples` function:
* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers
including zero.
* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique
and sorted in ascending order.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sum_of_multiples.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I updated a file. 
Filepath: sum_of_multiples.py

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all the unique multiples of the given factors
    that are less than the limit.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the multiples
    multiples_list = []

    # Iterate over the factors and calculate the multiples
    for factor in multiples:
        # Calculate the multiples of the current factor
        multiples_of_factor = [i * factor for i in range(1, limit // factor + 1)]

        # Add the multiples to the list
        multiples_list.extend(multiples_of_factor)

    # Remove duplicates from the list
    unique_multiples = list(set(multiples_list))

    # Calculate the sum of the unique multiples
    sum_of_multiples = sum(unique_multiples)

    return sum_of_multiples

```

In this implementation, we first initialize an empty list to store the multiples. We then iterate over the factors and calculate the multiples of each factor using a list comprehension. We then add the multiples to the list and remove duplicates using a set. Finally, we calculate the sum of the unique multiples and return it.

Note that we have made the following assumptions:

* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers including zero.
* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique and sorted in ascending order.

These assumptions are based on the instructions provided in the problem statement.</s>
