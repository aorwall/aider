The above code implements the ISBN-10 verification process as described in the instructions.
It takes an ISBN as a string input, replaces any dashes with empty strings, and checks if the length of the string is 10.
If the length is not 10, it returns False.

Next, it initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and iterates over the characters of the ISBN using the `enumerate` function.
For each character, it checks if the character is a digit.
If it is a digit, it multiplies the digit by the weight (10 - index) and adds it to the `sum`.
If the character is 'X' and it's in the last position (index 9), it adds 10 to the `sum`.
If the character is not a digit and not 'X', it returns False.

After iterating over all the characters, it checks if the `sum` is divisible by 11.
If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

The code follows the instructions and uses only standard Python libraries.
It also includes a docstring to explain the functionality of the `is_valid` function.
