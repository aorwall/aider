 To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that checks if a player has connected their stones to the opposite side of the board. We can do this by iterating through the board and checking if a player has a stone in a given position and if they have a stone in the position directly opposite it. If they do, we can return the winner.

Here's an example of how we can implement this algorithm in Python:
```
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def get_winner(self):
        for row in self.board:
            for col in row:
                if col == 'O' and self.board[row][col] == 'O':
                    return 'O'
                elif col == 'X' and self.board[row][col] == 'X':
                    return 'X'
        return None
```
In this implementation, we first initialize the `ConnectGame` class with a board. We then define the `get_winner` method, which iterates through the board and checks if a player has a stone in a given position and if they have a stone in the position directly opposite it. If they do, we return the winner. If no winner is found, we return `None`.

To use this implementation, we can create a `ConnectGame` object and call the `get_winner` method on it, passing in the board as an argument. For example:
```
board = [
    ['O', ' ', 'X', ' '],
    [' ', 'X', 'X', 'O'],
    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    [' ', 'X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X']
]

game = ConnectGame(board)
winner = game.get_winner()
print(winner)
```
This will output `O`, as `O` has connected their stones to the opposite side of the board.

Note that this implementation assumes that the board is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the board and each element in the inner list represents a column. The elements in the inner lists are either `'O'` or `'X'`, representing the stones of the two players.
