 The issue is that the `board` attribute of the `ConnectGame` class is a list of strings, but the code is trying to access it as if it were a list of lists.

To fix the issue, you can change the `board` attribute to be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the board. For example:
```
board = [
    ['O', ' ', 'X', ' '],
    [' ', 'X', 'X', 'O'],
    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    [' ', 'X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X']
]
```
Alternatively, you can change the code to access the `board` attribute as a list of strings, by using the `index()` method to get the index of the row and column that you want to access. For example:
```
def get_winner(self):
    for row in self.board:
        for col in row:
            if col == 'O' and self.board.index(row) == self.board.index(col):
                return 'O'
            elif col == 'X' and self.board.index(row) == self.board.index(col):
                return 'X'
    return None
```
This will fix the issue and allow the code to run correctly.
