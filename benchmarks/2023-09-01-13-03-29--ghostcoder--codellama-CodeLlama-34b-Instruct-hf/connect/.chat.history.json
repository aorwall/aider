O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
