####

Updated the `square` function to raise a `ValueError` with a message if the input square is not in the acceptable range.
Updated the `total` function to use a generator expression to calculate the total number of grains on the chessboard.
Kept the existing function and class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Did not implement or change any unit tests.
Only used standard python libraries, did not suggest installing any packages.
