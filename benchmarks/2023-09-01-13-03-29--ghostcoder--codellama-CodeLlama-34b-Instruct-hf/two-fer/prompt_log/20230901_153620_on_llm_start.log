# Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.
So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.
Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

| Name   | Dialogue                    |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |
| Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |
| Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |
|        | One for you, one for me.    |
| Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two_fer.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I updated file with Filepath: two_fer.py
Filepath: two_fer.py
```
def two_fer(name):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."

```

Explanation:

* The function `two_fer` takes a single argument `name`, which is a string representing the name of the person to whom the cookie will be given.
* If `name` is not empty, the function returns a string in the format "One for [name], one for me."
* If `name` is empty, the function returns the string "One for you, one for me."

Note: The existing function stubs in the `two_fer.py` file have been kept and implemented as per the instructions.</s>
