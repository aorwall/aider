def two_fer(name):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```

Explanation:

* The function `two_fer` takes a single argument `name`, which is a string representing the name of the person to whom the cookie will be given.
* If `name` is not empty, the function returns a string in the format "One for [name], one for me."
* If `name` is empty, the function returns the string "One for you, one for me."

Note: The existing function stubs in the `two_fer.py` file have been kept and implemented as per the instructions.
