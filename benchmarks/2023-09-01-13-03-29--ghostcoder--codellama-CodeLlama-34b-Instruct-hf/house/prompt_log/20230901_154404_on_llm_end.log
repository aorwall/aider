    return verses[start_verse-1:end_verse]
```

Explanation:

I have modified the `recite` function to return a list of verses from the nursery rhyme, starting from the `start_verse` and ending at the `end_verse`. The verses are stored in a list called `verses`. The function returns the slice of the list that corresponds to the requested verses.

Note that the verses are numbered starting from 1, so the first verse is at index 0 in the list.
