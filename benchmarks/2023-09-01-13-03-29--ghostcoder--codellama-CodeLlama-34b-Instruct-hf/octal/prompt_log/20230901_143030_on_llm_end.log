```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(digits):
        decimal += int(digit) * 8 ** i
    return decimal

```

In this implementation, we iterate over each digit in the octal string using the `enumerate` function. We convert each digit to an integer using the `int` function, and then multiply it by 8 raised to the power of the digit's position in the string (i.e. the index `i`). We then add this product to the `decimal` variable, which will represent the decimal equivalent of the octal string.

For example, if the input string is "1735263", the first digit "1" will be converted to an integer and multiplied by 8^0 (i.e. 1), then added to `decimal`. The second digit "7" will be converted to an integer and multiplied by 8^1 (i.e. 8), then added to `decimal`. And so on.

Finally, we return the `decimal` variable, which will contain the decimal equivalent of the input octal string.
