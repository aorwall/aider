 The issue with the code is that the `rows` function is not implemented. The function is defined, but it does not have any code inside it.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `rows` function. The function should take a letter as input and return a list of strings representing the rows of the diamond shape.

Here is an example of how you can implement the `rows` function:
```
def rows(letter):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the rows of the diamond shape
    diamond_shape = []

    # Get the number of rows in the diamond shape
    num_rows = ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1

    # Loop through each row of the diamond shape
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Get the number of spaces and letters in the current row
        num_spaces = num_rows - i - 1
        num_letters = i + 1

        # Create a string representing the current row of the diamond shape
        row = '·' * num_spaces + letter * num_letters + '·' * num_spaces

        # Add the current row to the list of rows
        diamond_shape.append(row)

    # Return the list of strings representing the diamond shape
    return diamond_shape
```
This implementation uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII code of the letter, and then uses that code to determine the number of rows in the diamond shape. It then loops through each row, calculates the number of spaces and letters in the row, and creates a string representing the row. Finally, it adds the row to a list of rows and returns the list.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
