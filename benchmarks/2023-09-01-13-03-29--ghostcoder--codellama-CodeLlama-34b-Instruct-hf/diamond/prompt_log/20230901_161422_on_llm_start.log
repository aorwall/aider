# Instructions

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.
Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] As a helpful Senior Developer, I have reviewed the provided code and made some modifications to improve the overall structure and readability of the code. Here are the changes I have made:

1. Added a docstring to the `rows` function to provide a brief description of what the function does.
2. Renamed the `letter` parameter to `target_letter` to make the code more readable.
3. Added a new function called `get_diamond_shape` that takes a letter as input and returns a list of strings representing the diamond shape.
4. Modified the `rows` function to call the `get_diamond_shape` function and return the resulting list of strings.
5. Added a new function called `print_diamond` that takes a list of strings as input and prints them to the console.
6. Modified the `main` function to call the `print_diamond` function with the result of the `rows` function.

Here is the updated code:


```pyton
def rows(target_letter):
    """
    Returns a list of strings representing the diamond shape for the given letter.
    """
    # Get the diamond shape for the target letter
    diamond_shape = get_diamond_shape(target_letter)

    # Return the list of strings representing the diamond shape
    return diamond_shape

def get_diamond_shape(letter):
    """
    Returns a list of strings representing the diamond shape for the given letter.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the diamond shape
    diamond_shape = []

    # Get the number of rows in the diamond shape
    num_rows = ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1

    # Loop through each row of the diamond shape
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Get the number of spaces and letters in the current row
        num_spaces = num_rows - i - 1
        num_letters = i + 1

        # Create a string representing the current row of the diamond shape
        row = '·' * num_spaces + letter * num_letters + '·' * num_spaces

        # Add the current row to the list of rows
        diamond_shape.append(row)

    # Return the list of strings representing the diamond shape
    return diamond_shape

def print_diamond(diamond_shape):
    """
    Prints the diamond shape to the console.
    """
    # Loop through each row of the diamond shape
    for row in diamond_shape:
        # Print the current row to the console
        print(row)

def main():
    # Get the target letter from the user
    target_letter = input("Enter a letter: ")

    # Get the diamond shape for the target letter
    diamond_shape = rows(target_letter)

    # Print the diamond shape to the console
    print_diamond(diamond_shape)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

I hope this updated code meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.</s>
