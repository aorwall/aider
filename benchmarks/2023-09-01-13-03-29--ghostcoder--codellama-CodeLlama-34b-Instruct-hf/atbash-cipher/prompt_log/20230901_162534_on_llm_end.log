 The issue with the code is that the `encode` and `decode` functions are not implemented. They are both defined, but they do not contain any code.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `encode` and `decode` functions. Here is an example of how you could implement them:
```
def encode(plain_text):
    cipher_text = ""
    for char in plain_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            cipher_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        else:
            cipher_text += char
    return cipher_text

def decode(cipher_text):
    plain_text = ""
    for char in cipher_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            plain_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        else:
            plain_text += char
    return plain_text
```
This code uses the Atbash cipher to encode and decode the text. It iterates over each character in the input text, and if it is a letter, it replaces it with the corresponding letter in the ciphertext alphabet (which is the Latin alphabet in reverse). If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged.

With these implementations, the tests should pass.
