```pyton
def factors(value):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(value**0.5) + 1):
        while value % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            value //= i
    if value > 1:
        factors.append(value)
    return factors

```

In this implementation, we use a list to store the prime factors and a for loop to iterate through the possible divisors. We start with the smallest divisor, 2, and check if it goes into the value. If it does, we add it to the list of factors and divide the value by the divisor. We continue this process until the value is 1, at which point we return the list of factors.

Note that we use the `int` function to convert the result of `value**0.5` to an integer, as the `range` function requires an integer as its second argument. We also use the `//=` operator to divide the value by the divisor and assign the result back to the value, as this is more efficient than using the `/=` operator.

Finally, we check if the value is greater than 1 after the loop, as this means that the value is prime and should be added to the list of factors.
