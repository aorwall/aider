 I have updated the `diffie_hellman.py` file to implement the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm using the `random` module.

Here is the updated file:
```pyton
import random

def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)

def public_key(p, g, private):
    return pow(g, private, p)

def secret(p, public, private):
    return pow(public, private, p)
```
I have implemented the `private_key` function to generate a random private key between 2 and `p - 1`.

I have implemented the `public_key` function to generate a public key using the `pow` function with the `g` value, the private key, and the `p` value.

I have implemented the `secret` function to generate a shared secret key using the `pow` function with the public key, the private key, and the `p` value.

Note that this implementation uses the `random` module, which is pseudo-random and should not be used for cryptography.

Also, note that this implementation does not include any error handling or validation, and is only intended for educational purposes.
