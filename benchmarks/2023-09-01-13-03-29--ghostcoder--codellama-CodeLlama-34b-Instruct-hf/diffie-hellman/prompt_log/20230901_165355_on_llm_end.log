 The issue is that the `private_key` function is not returning any value, so the `key` variable in the test is `None`.

To fix the issue, you need to modify the `private_key` function to return a value. Here's an example:
```pyton
def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)
```
This will return a random integer between 2 and `p - 1`, which should be a valid private key.

With this change, the tests should pass.
