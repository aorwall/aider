# Instructions

Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:

```text
  a b c d e f g h
8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 8
7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7
6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 6
5 _ _ W _ _ _ _ _ 5
4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 4
3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 3
2 _ _ _ _ _ B _ _ 2
1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1
  a b c d e f g h
```

You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" `ValueErrors` if the `Queen` constructor is passed numbers that are negative, or numbers that are not a valid row or column.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it. You also should `raise` a `ValueError` if both the queens passed to the `can_attack()` method are on the same location.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the row parameter is negative
raise ValueError("row not positive")

# if the row parameter is not on the defined board
raise ValueError("row not on board")

# if the column parameter is negative
raise ValueError("column not positive")

# if the column parameter is not on the defined board
raise ValueError("column not on board")

# if both the queens are on the same location
raise ValueError("Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square")
```
