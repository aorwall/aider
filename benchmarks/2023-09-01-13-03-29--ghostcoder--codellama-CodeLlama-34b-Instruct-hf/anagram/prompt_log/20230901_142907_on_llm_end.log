```

In the above code, I have implemented the `find_anagrams` function as per the instructions provided. The function takes two arguments: `word` and `candidates`. It returns a list of anagrams found in the `candidates` list.

The function first creates a dictionary `target_letter_count` to store the letter counts of the `word`. It then creates an empty list `anagrams` to store the anagrams found.

The function then iterates over the `candidates` list and checks if each candidate is an anagram of the `word`. If a candidate is an anagram, it is added to the `anagrams` list.

The function returns the `anagrams` list at the end.

Note that the function uses the `==` operator to compare the letter counts of the `word` and the `candidate` words. This is because the `==` operator checks if the two dictionaries have the same keys and values, which is exactly what we want to check for anagrams.
