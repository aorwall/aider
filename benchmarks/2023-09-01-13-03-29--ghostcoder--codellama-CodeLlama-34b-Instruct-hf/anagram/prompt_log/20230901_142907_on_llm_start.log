# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.
A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.

Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.

The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).
Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.
The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).
Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.

Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.

    return anagrams
```

In the above code, I have implemented the `find_anagrams` function as per the instructions provided. The function takes two arguments: `word` and `candidates`. It returns a list of anagrams found in the `candidates` list.

The function first creates a dictionary `target_letter_count` to store the letter counts of the `word`. It then creates an empty list `anagrams` to store the anagrams found.

The function then iterates over the `candidates` list and checks if each candidate is an anagram of the `word`. If a candidate is an anagram, it is added to the `anagrams` list.

The function returns the `anagrams` list at the end.

Note that the function uses the `==` operator to compare the letter counts of the `word` and the `candidate` words. This is because the `==` operator checks if the two dictionaries have the same keys and values, which is exactly what we want to check for anagrams.</s>
