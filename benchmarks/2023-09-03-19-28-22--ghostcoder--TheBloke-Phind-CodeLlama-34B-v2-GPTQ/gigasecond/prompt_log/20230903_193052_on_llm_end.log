To solve this problem, you could define a function named `add()`, which takes a datetime object and adds exactly one gigasecond (10^9 seconds) to it. Here's how you might go about implementing such a function using Python's built-in `datetime` library.


Firstly, import the necessary modules:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```


Next, define the function that takes a datetime object representing the birthdate, calculates the amount of time elapsed since then, checks whether adding a gigasecond goes beyond the current date limit (which is February 7, 24716 AD), and returns the result. If it doesn't exceed the limit, it adds the given duration, else it subtracts the difference from the max possible seconds till February 7, 24104.
```python
def add(birthdate):
    # Calculate the exact time elapsed since the birthdate
    elapsed = datetime.now() - birthdate
    
    # Check if adding a gigasecond exceeds the current date limit
    if elapsed <= timedelta(seconds=1e9):
        return birthdate + timedelta(seconds=1e9)
    else:
        return datetime(24104, 2, 7) - timedelta(days=1) + (elapsed - timedelta(seconds=1e9))
```
You may want to format the output date accordingly when returning.


Now, you just have to create a datetime object and call your function. Let's assume 'January 24th, 2015 at 222:000 PM' is represented as `'January 4, 2015, 222:000'`;
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    birthdate = datetime.strptime('January 4, 2015, 222:000', '%B %d, %Y, %H:%M')
    print("I was born on", birthdate)
    future_date = add(birthdate)
    print("One gigasecond later I will be", future_date.strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y, %H:%M"))
```
