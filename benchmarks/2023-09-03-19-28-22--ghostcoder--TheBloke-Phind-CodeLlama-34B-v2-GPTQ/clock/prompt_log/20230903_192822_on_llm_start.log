### User Message
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### User Message
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Explanation:
In the is_palindrome function, we first convert the string to lowercase and remove spaces to make the check case and space insensitive. Then we compare the string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Explanation:
In the Rectangle class, the area method calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying its length and width, and returns the result.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your clock will be implemented via a Clock `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.
## Representing your class

When working with and debugging objects, it's important to have a string representation of that object.
For example, if you were to create a new `datetime.datetime` object in the Python [REPL][REPL] environment, you could see its string representation:

```python
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> new_date = datetime(2022, 5, 4)
>>> new_date
datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4, 0, 0)
```

Your Clock `class` will create a custom `object` that handles times without dates.
One important aspect of this `class` will be how it is represented as a _string_.
Other programmers who use or call Clock `objects` created from the Clock `class` will refer to this string representation for debugging and other activities.  
However, the default string representation on a `class` is usually not very helpful.

```python
>>> Clock(12, 34)
<Clock object st 0x102807b20 >
```

To create a more helpful representation, you can define a `__repr__` method on the `class` that returns a string.

Ideally, the `__repr__` method returns valid Python code that can be used to recreate the object -- as laid out in the [specification for a `__repr__` method][repr-docs].
Returning valid Python code allows you to copy-paste the `str` directly into code or the REPL.

For example, a `Clock` that represents 11:30 AM could look like this: `Clock(11, 30)`.

Defining a `__repr__` method is good practice for all classes.
Some things to consider:

- The information returned from this method should be beneficial when debugging issues.
- _Ideally_, the method returns a string that is valid Python code -- although that might not always be possible.
- If valid Python code is not practical, returning a description between angle brackets: `< ...a practical description... >` is the convention.


### String conversion

In addition to the `__repr__` method, there might also be a need for an alternative "human-readable" string representation of the `class`.
This might be used to format the object for program output or documentation.
Looking at `datetime.datetime` again:

```python
>>> str(datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4))
'2022-05-04 00:00:00'
```

When a `datetime` object is asked to convert itself to a string representation, it returns a `str` formatted according to the [ISO 8601 standard][ISO 8601], which can be parsed by most datetime libraries into a human-readable date and time.

In this exercise, you will get a chance to write a `__str__` method, as well as a `__repr__`.

```python
>>> str(Clock(11, 30))
'11:30'
```

To support this string conversion, you will need to create a `__str__` method on your class that returns a more "human readable" string showing the Clock time.

If you don't create a `__str__` method and you call `str()` on your class, python will try calling `__repr__` on your class as a fallback. So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: clock.py
```python
class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour, minute):
        pass

    def __repr__(self):
        pass

    def __str__(self):
        pass

    def __eq__(self, other):
        pass

    def __add__(self, minutes):
        pass

    def __sub__(self, minutes):
        pass

```
