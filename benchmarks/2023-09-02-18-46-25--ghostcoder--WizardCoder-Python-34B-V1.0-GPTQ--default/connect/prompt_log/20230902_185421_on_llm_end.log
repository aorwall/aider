Explanation:
The `_check_winning_move` function checks whether there is a winning move starting from `start_pos`. It uses DFS to traverse through the board and mark all connected positions with the same color as `player`. If it reaches either end of the board, then that player has won. The main `get_winner` function iterates over each cell on the board and calls this function for both players. If any of them returns `True`, it means they have won and the game ends. Otherwise, the function returns None indicating a tie. Note that we assume that the input board is valid, i.e., contains only two different characters other than `.`.
