O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

It uses DFS to traverse through the board and mark all connected positions with the same color as `player`. If it reaches either end of the board, then that player has won. The main `get_winner` function iterates over each cell on the board and calls this function for both players. If any of them returns `True`, it means they have won and the game ends. Otherwise, the function returns None indicating a tie. Note that we assume that the input board is valid, i.e., contains only two different characters other than `.`.",
