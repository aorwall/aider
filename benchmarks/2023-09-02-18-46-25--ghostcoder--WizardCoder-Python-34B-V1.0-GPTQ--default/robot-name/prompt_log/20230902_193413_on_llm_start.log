# Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
