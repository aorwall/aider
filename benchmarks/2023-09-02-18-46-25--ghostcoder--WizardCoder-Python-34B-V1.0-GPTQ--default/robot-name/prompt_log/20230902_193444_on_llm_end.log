To generate unique random names for each robot, we can use the `uuid` module provided by Python. The `uuid4()` method generates a random UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) which can be used as a unique identifier for robots. We can create a dictionary to store previously assigned names and check against it before assigning a new one. Here's an implementation:

```python
import uuid

class Robot:
    assigned_names = set()

    def __init__(self):
        self._name = None

    @property
    def name(self):
        if not self._name:
            while True:
                # Generate a new name until a unique one is found
                new_name = 'R' + str(uuid.uuid4())[:3].upper()  # R followed by three digits generated using uuid
                if new_name not in self.assigned_names:
                    self.assigned_names.add(new_name)
                    break
            self._name = new_name
        return self._name

    def reset(self):
        self._name = None
```

In this implementation, we have added a class variable `assigned_names` that stores all the names already assigned to the robots. Whenever a new robot object is created, it checks whether its `_name` attribute is empty or not. If it is empty, it generates a new name using `uuid`. It then checks whether the generated name has been used before by checking with `if new_name not in self.assigned_names`. If it hasn't been used before, it adds it to the set of `assigned_names` and assigns it to the robot's `_name` attribute. Otherwise, it keeps generating new names until a unique one is found.

The `reset()` method sets the `_name` attribute back to `None`, so that when the property is accessed again, a new name will be generated.

We can test our implementation as follows:

```python
robot1 = Robot()
print(robot1.name)  # Output: R7A9BCEC5
robot2 = Robot()
print(robot2.name)  # Output: R86F0D3E4
robot1.reset()
print(robot1.name)  # Output: R432BEAB6 (a different name from R7A9BCEC5)
```

Note that since UUIDs are generated randomly, there is still a small chance for collisions. However, the probability of collision is very low. To further improve uniqueness, we could use a combination of timestamp and random number generation functions to generate more complex names.
