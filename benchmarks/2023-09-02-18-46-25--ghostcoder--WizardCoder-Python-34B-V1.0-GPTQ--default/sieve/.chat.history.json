Find the next unmarked number in your list. This is a prime number.\n2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as composite (not prime).\n\nYou keep repeating these steps until you've gone through every number in your list.\nAt the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\n[Wikipedia's Sieve of Eratosthenes article][eratosthenes] has a useful graphic that explains the algorithm.\n\nThe tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct list of primes.\nA good first test is to check that you do not use division or remainder operations.\n\n[eratosthenes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\n~~~~\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sieve.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

        "text": "Explanation:\n\nThe `primes` function takes an integer argument `limit`, which represents the upper bound of the range of integers we want to find primes within. The function returns a list of all prime numbers between 2 and `limit`. We start by creating a boolean array called `is_prime` that has length `limit+1`, where every element is initially set to True. We know that 0 and 1 are not prime, so we mark them as False.\n\nWe then iterate over all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `limit`, checking if they are prime using the `is_prime` array. If a number is prime, we cross out its multiples by setting their corresponding elements in `is_prime` to False. Finally, we create a new list containing only the prime numbers by iterating through `is_prime` and appending the indices with value True to our `primes` list.\n\n\nThis implementation avoids division or remainder operations by using a boolean array instead of dividing or taking remainders. It also uses list comprehension to simplify the code.",
