Explanation:

The `primes` function takes an integer argument `limit`, which represents the upper bound of the range of integers we want to find primes within. The function returns a list of all prime numbers between 2 and `limit`. We start by creating a boolean array called `is_prime` that has length `limit+1`, where every element is initially set to True. We know that 0 and 1 are not prime, so we mark them as False.

We then iterate over all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `limit`, checking if they are prime using the `is_prime` array. If a number is prime, we cross out its multiples by setting their corresponding elements in `is_prime` to False. Finally, we create a new list containing only the prime numbers by iterating through `is_prime` and appending the indices with value True to our `primes` list.


This implementation avoids division or remainder operations by using a boolean array instead of dividing or taking remainders. It also uses list comprehension to simplify the code.
