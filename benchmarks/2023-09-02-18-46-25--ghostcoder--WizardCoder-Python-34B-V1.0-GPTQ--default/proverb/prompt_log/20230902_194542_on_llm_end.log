We added an additional function `proverb_with_qualifier` that takes an optional keyword argument `qualifier`. If this argument is provided and not empty, it will be used to replace the word "all" in the final line of the proverb.
The original `proverb` function remains unchanged. 

### Example usage

```python
>>> print(proverb(["nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"]))
