Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

```


### Instruction:
Filepath: binary.py
```pyton
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    pass

```

# Instructions

Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.

Implement binary to decimal conversion.
Given a binary input string, your program should produce a decimal output.
The program should handle invalid inputs.

## Note

- Implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About Binary (Base-2)

Decimal is a base-10 system.

A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:

- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1
- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10
- ...
- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.
- All these values are summed.

So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`

Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.

So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal
raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + digits)
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
