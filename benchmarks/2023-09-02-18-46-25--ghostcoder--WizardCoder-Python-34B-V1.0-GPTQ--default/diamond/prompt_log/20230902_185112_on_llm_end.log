Here is an implementation of the diamond kata using Python:

```python
def rows(letter):
    # Get the ASCII code of the input letter
    ascii_code = ord(letter)
    
    # Initialize variables
    n = ascii_code - 64
    midpoint = (n + 1) // 2
    height = n * 2 - 1
    
    # Create a list of lists to store each row of the diamond
    diamond = [[''] * n for _ in range(height)]
    
    # Loop through each row of the diamond
    for i in range(midpoint):
        # Calculate number of leading spaces and trailing spaces for this row
        num_spaces = n - i - 1
        num_letters = 2*i + 1
        
        # Fill in the middle character(s) for this row
        if num_letters == 1:
            diamond[i] = 'A'
        else:
            diamond[i] = ('·' * num_spaces) + chr(ascii_code-1+i) + ('·' * num_spaces)
        
        # Copy the same pattern for the bottom half of the diamond
        diamond[-i-1] = diamond[i][::-1]
    
    # Print out the diamond
    for row in diamond:
        print(''.join(row))
```

Explanation:

The function `rows` takes an input letter, converts it to its ASCII code using the built-in `ord()` function, subtracts 64 (the ASCII code for 'A') from it to get the width of the diamond. It then calculates the midpoint of the diamond and initializes a list of empty strings with length equal to the height of the diamond.

It loops through each row of the top half of the diamond, calculating the number of leading spaces and trailing spaces based on the current row index (`i`). If there is only one letter in the row, it sets that row to be 'A', otherwise it fills in the middle characters by concatenating the correct number of spaces and letters.

Finally, it copies the pattern of each row to the corresponding row at the bottom of the diamond by reversing the string representation of the top row.


Here are some examples of how to use this function:

```python
>>> rows('C')
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··

>>> rows('E')
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```
