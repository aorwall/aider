Here's one possible implementation for the `is_paired` function using a stack data structure:

```python
def is_paired(input_string):
    """
    Given a string containing brackets, determine whether each pair is properly nested.
    
    Args:
        input_string (str): A string containing brackets [](){}
    Returns:
        bool: True if all brackets are paired and nested correctly, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create an empty stack to store opening brackets
    stack = []
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets with their respective opening ones
    mappings = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If it's an opening bracket, add it to the stack
        if char in ['{', '[', '(']:
            stack.append(char)
        # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the last opening bracket added to the stack
        elif char in [']', ')', '}']:
            if len(stack) == 0 or mappings[char] != stack[-1]:
                return False
            else:
                stack.pop()
    # If there are no more characters left in the string and all pairs have been matched, return True
    return len(stack) == 0
```

This implementation uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets as they appear in the string. Whenever an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket appears, we check if it matches the last opening bracket on top of the stack. If not, then the pairing is incorrect and we can immediately return `False`. Otherwise, we remove that opening bracket from the stack since it has been properly closed.


If the loop completes without returning `False`, then all brackets must be paired correctly and the function returns `True` at the end. The length of the stack should be zero because all opening brackets should have been removed by this point.
