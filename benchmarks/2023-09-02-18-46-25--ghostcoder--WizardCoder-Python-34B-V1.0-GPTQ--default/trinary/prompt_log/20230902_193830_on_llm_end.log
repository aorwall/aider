```python
def trinary(string):
    if not all(c in '012' for c in string):
        return 0
    decimal_value = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(string)):
        decimal_value += int(digit) * (3 ** i)
    return decimal_value
```

Explanation:

The original code was missing an implementation of the `trinary` function that converts a given trinary number string into its decimal equivalent.

I added a simple implementation using the provided formula for converting a trinary number to decimal. 

We first check if there are only valid digits in the input string by checking if each character is either '0', '1', or '2'. If not, we return 0 as per the requirements.

Then, we iterate through the characters in reverse order, starting with the least significant digit at index 0, and calculate their decimal value based on their position in the string. We add up these values to get the final decimal result.


Note that this assumes that the input string represents a valid trinary number, so no error handling is needed for invalid inputs.
