prompt:
Filepath: leap.py
```python
def leap_year(year):
    """
    Returns True if the given year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

Explanation:
The code uses the rule mentioned in the prompt to determine whether a year is a leap year or not. If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year. However, if it is divisible by both 100 and 400, then it is still a leap year. This is because years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. The `and` operator ensures that this condition is met before returning True for a leap year.
