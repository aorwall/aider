Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.\n\n- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)\n- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

The `get_top_three()` method returns the first three elements of the sorted list, or an empty list if there are less than three scores.
