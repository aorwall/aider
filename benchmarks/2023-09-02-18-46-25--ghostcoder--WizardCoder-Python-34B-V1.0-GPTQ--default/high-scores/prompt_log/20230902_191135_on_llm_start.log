# Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)
- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's an implementation of the `HighScores` class with the required methods:
Filepath: high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)

    def get_highest(self):
        """Returns the highest score."""
        return self.scores[0] if len(self.scores) > 0 else None

    def get_last(self):
        """Returns the last added score."""
        return self.scores[-1] if len(self.scores) > 0 else None

    def get_top_three(self):
        """Returns a list containing the three highest scores."""
        return self.scores[:3] if len(self.scores) >= 3 else []

```

The `__init__()` method takes a list of scores as input and sorts it in descending order using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the first element is always the highest score. The `get_highest()` method simply returns the first element of the sorted list, while the `get_last()` method returns the last element (which is also the lowest since we sorted the list in descending order). The `get_top_three()` method returns the first three elements of the sorted list, or an empty list if there are less than three scores. If you want to add more functionality later on, such as adding new scores or removing them, you can modify this class accordingly.
### Instruction:
Filepath: high_scores.py
```pyton
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)

    def get_highest(self):
        """Returns the highest score."""
        return self.scores[0] if len(self.scores) > 0 else None

    def get_last(self):
        """Returns the last added score."""
        return self.scores[-1] if len(self.scores) > 0 else None

    def get_top_three(self):
        """Returns a list containing the three highest scores."""
        return self.scores[:3] if len(self.scores) >= 3 else []

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.
