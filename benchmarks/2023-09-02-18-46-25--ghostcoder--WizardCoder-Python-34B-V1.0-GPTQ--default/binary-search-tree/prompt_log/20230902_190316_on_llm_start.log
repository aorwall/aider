# Instructions

Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.

When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.

Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.
Now we must sort the entire array again!
We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.
But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.

Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.

A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.
Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.
The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.
Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.
All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.

For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:

      4
     /
    2

If we then added 6, it would look like this:

      4
     / \
    2   6

If we then added 3, it would look like this

       4
     /   \
    2     6
     \
      3

And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this

          4
        /   \
       /     \
      2       6
     / \     / \
    1   3   5   7

```

Explanation:
We added an `__init__()` method to the `TreeNode` class with a default value of None for both left and right child nodes. We also updated the `__str__()` method to include `left` and `right`. In the `BinarySearchTree` class, we initialized the root as `None`, implemented the `insert()` method to insert new values into the tree by comparing the input data with the current node's data and traversing down the tree until it finds the correct position to insert the new value. The `search()` method now checks whether the input data matches any node's data or not. If yes, returns True, else False. Finally, we added a `sorted_data()` method which uses recursion to traverse through the tree in-order (Left subtree, Root Node, Right subtree) and append the values to a list in ascending order.
