# Instructions

A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.

`a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.
The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.
The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.

The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:
`(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,
`(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.

Multiplication result is by definition
`(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.

The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is
`1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.

Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:
`(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.

Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.

Implement the following operations:

- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,
- conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.

Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.

The implementation of the `ComplexNumber` class is complete with all required methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation. The `__init__()` method has been updated to set default values for both real and imaginary parts if not provided during initialization. The `__eq__()` method checks if two complex numbers are equal by comparing their real and imaginary parts. The `__add__()`, `__sub__()` and `__mul__()` methods perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers as described in the problem statement. The `__truediv__()` method performs division operation using the formula `(a + ib)/(c+id) = (ac-bd)/(c^2+d^2)+i(ad/cd)` where a, b, c, d are real and imaginary parts of numerator and denominator respectively. The `__abs__()` method calculates the absolute value of a complex number using the formula `|z|=sqrt(a^2+b^2)`. The `conjugate()` method returns the conjugate of a given complex number by negating its imaginary part. The `exp()` method uses Euler's formula to calculate the exponential of a complex number.
