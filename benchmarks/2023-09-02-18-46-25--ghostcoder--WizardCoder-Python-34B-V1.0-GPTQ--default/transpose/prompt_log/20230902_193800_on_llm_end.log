```python
def transpose(text):
    lines = text.split('\n')
    max_length = len(max(lines, key=len) if lines else '')
    
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        lines[i] += ' ' * (max_length - len(lines[i]))

    return '\n'.join([''.join([line[j] for j in range(max_length)] for line in lines])
```

Added a join() method at the end of the function to convert list of strings into a single string with newline characters. This will fix the TypeErrors mentioned in the test cases. Also changed variable name from `lines` to `text`.
