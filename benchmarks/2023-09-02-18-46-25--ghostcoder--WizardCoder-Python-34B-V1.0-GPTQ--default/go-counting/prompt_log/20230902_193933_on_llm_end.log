# Solution

## Plan
1. Create a helper function `_valid_coord` to check whether the given coordinates are valid or not.
2. Implement the `_territory` method to find the territory of a player starting from the given point.
3. Modify the `territory` method to call the `_territory` method with the correct parameters.
4. Implement the `territories` method to iterate through all points on the board and call the `_territory` method for each player's stones.
5. Update the docstrings accordingly.
6. Add more test cases to cover edge cases and exceptions.

## Dry Run
Let's dry run the solution with an example board:

```text
+----+
|IOOI|
|O  O|
|O BI|
|IO I|
+----+
```

For this board, let's say we want to calculate the territory for the stone at (0, 2).

The first step is to create a set to store the visited positions. We start with an empty set.
Then, we mark the current position as visited and add it to the set.
Next, we loop over its neighbors (up, down, left, right) recursively calling the `_territory` method if they belong to the same player and haven't been visited yet.
We keep doing this until there are no unvisited neighbors left.

For example, when visiting the stone at (0, 1), we will add it to the set and then check its neighbors (1, 1) and (0, 3).
(1, 1) belongs to the other player so we skip it but (0, 3) belongs to the same player and hasn't been visited before, so we add it to the set and continue checking its neighbors (0, 4) and (1, 2).
(0, 4) also belongs to the same player and has not been visited before, so we add it to the set and continue checking its neighbor (1, 3).
Since (1, 3) doesn't belong to the same player or is out of range, we stop here and return the set containing all the points that belong to the player.
