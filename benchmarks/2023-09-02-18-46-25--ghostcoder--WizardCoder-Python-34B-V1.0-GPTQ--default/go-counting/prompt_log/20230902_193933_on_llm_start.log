# Instructions

Count the scored points on a Go board.

In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.
The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.

Write a function that determines the territory of each player.
You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.

Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.

Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.
In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).
Empty spaces represent empty intersections.

```text
+----+
|IOOI|
|O  O|
|O OI|
|IOI |
+----+
```

To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the coordinates for the piece are invalid
raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')
```

# Solution

## Plan
1. Create a helper function `_valid_coord` to check whether the given coordinates are valid or not.
2. Implement the `_territory` method to find the territory of a player starting from the given point.
3. Modify the `territory` method to call the `_territory` method with the correct parameters.
4. Implement the `territories` method to iterate through all points on the board and call the `_territory` method for each player's stones.
5. Update the docstrings accordingly.
6. Add more test cases to cover edge cases and exceptions.

## Dry Run
Let's dry run the solution with an example board:
```text
+----+
|IOOI|
|O  O|
|O BI|
|IO I|
+----+
```

For this board, let's say we want to calculate the territory for the stone at (0, 2).

The first step is to create a set to store the visited positions. We start with an empty set.
Then, we mark the current position as visited and add it to the set.
Next, we loop over its neighbors (up, down, left, right) recursively calling the `_territory` method if they belong to the same player and haven't been visited yet.
We keep doing this until there are no unvisited neighbors left.

For example, when visiting the stone at (0, 1), we will add it to the set and then check its neighbors (1, 1) and (0, 3).
(1, 1) belongs to the other player so we skip it but (0, 3) belongs to the same player and hasn't been visited before, so we add it to the set and continue checking its neighbors (0, 4) and (1, 2).
(0, 4) also belongs to the same player and has not been visited before, so we add it to the set and continue checking its neighbor (1, 3).
Since (1, 3) doesn't belong to the same player or is out of range, we stop here and return the set containing all the points that belong to the player.
