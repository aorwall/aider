# Instructions

Implement run-length encoding and decoding.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data elements) are replaced by just one data value and count.

For example we can represent the original 53 characters with only 13.

```text
"WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"  ->  "12WB12W3B24WB"
```

RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, which makes it a lossless data compression.

```text
"AABCCCDEEEE"  ->  "2AB3CD4E"  ->  "AABCCCDEEEE"
```

For simplicity, you can assume that the unencoded string will only contain the letters A through Z (either lower or upper case) and whitespace.
This way data to be encoded will never contain any numbers and numbers inside data to be decoded always represent the count for the following character.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: run_length_encoding.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

    return result

```

Explanation:
The `decode` function takes an input string that has been encoded with RLE and returns the original uncompressed string.
It iterates through each character of the input string, checking whether it is a digit (representing the count) or not. If it's a digit, it extracts the count and adds the corresponding number of characters to the output string. Otherwise, it appends the character directly to the output string.

The `encode` function takes an input string and compresses it using RLE. It keeps track of the current character and its count, adding them to the output string when a new character is encountered. The final count and character are added at the end to ensure the last sequence is included in the output as well.

            count = int(string[index])
            char = string[index + 1]
            result += char * count
            index += 2
        else:
            result += string[index]
            index += 1
    return result


def encode(string):
    """Encode a string using RLE."""
    result = ""
    prev_char = None
    count = 1
    for char in string:
        if char == prev_char:
            count += 1
        else:
            if prev_char is not None:
                result += str(count) + prev_char
            prev_char = char
            count = 1
    if prev_char is not None:
        result += str(count) + prev_char
    return result

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in run_length_encoding.py to resolve the errors.
