# Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: triangle.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Filepath: triangle.py
```
def equilateral(sides):
    """Determines if a triangle with given sides is an equilateral triangle."""
    return len(set(sides)) == 1


def isosceles(sides):
    """Determines if a triangle with given sides is an isosceles triangle."""
    unique_sides = set(sides)
    return len(unique_sides) < 3 or max(unique_sides) >= min(sides) - max(sides)


def scalene(sides):
    """Determines if a triangle with given sides is a scalene triangle."""
    return len(set(sides)) == 3

```

The original code was missing implementations for the functions `equilateral` and `isosceles`. The `scalene` function was already implemented correctly.

def scalene(sides):
    """Determines if a triangle with given sides is a scalene triangle."""
    return len(set(sides)) == 3

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in triangle.py to resolve the errors.
