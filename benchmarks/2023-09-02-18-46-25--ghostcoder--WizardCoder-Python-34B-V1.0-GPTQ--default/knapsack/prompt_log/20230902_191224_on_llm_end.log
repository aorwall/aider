The solution to this problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a table dp[i][j], where i represents the number of items considered and j represents the maximum weight that can be carried by Bob. The value at dp[i][j] represents the maximum value that can be obtained with i items and j weight. If we consider the ith item, then there are two possibilities - either we include it or exclude it. If we include it, then the maximum value would be (dp[i-1][j-w_i] + v_i), where w_i is the weight of the ith item and v_i is its corresponding value. If we exclude it, then the maximum value would be dp[i-1][j]. Therefore, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-w_i]+v_i).

We start filling up the table row by row, starting from 0th item and considering all possible weights upto W. At each cell, we calculate the maximum value that can be obtained with i items and j weight. Finally, the answer would be dp[n][W], where n is the total number of items.

Here's the updated code for knapsack.py:

```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    n = len(items)
    dp = [[0]*(maximum_weight+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Fill the first column with zeros as we cannot take any item if we have no capacity
    for i in range(n+1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
        
    # Fill the first row with zeros as we cannot take any item if we don't have any items to choose from
    for j in range(maximum_weight+1):
        dp[0][j] = 0
        
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        w_i, v_i = items[i-1]['weight'], items[i-1]['value']
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight+1):
            if j < w_i:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-w_i]+v_i)
                
    return dp[n][maximum_weight]
```

Now let's test our function on the given example:

```python
items = [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]
knapsack_limit = 10
print(maximum_value(knapsack_limit, items)) # Output: 90
```
