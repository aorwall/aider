# Instructions

Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.

The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.
A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.

If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.

## Examples

For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):

```text
·*·*·
··*··
··*··
·····
```

And your code will transform it into this:

```text
1*3*1
13*31
·2*2·
·111·
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()` function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the board receives malformed input
raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: minesweeper.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

    try:
        rows = int(input("Enter number of rows: "))
        cols = int(input("Enter number of columns: "))

        if rows < 1 or cols < 1:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input: Rows and Columns must be greater than zero.")

        minefield = [[' ' * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        num_mines = int(input("Enter number of mines: "))
        
        if num_mines > rows * cols:
            raise ValueError("Too many mines for the given size of the board.")

        while num_mines > 0:
            r, c = random.randint(0, rows - 1), random.randint(0, cols - 1)
            if minefield[r][c] != '*':
                minefield[r][c] = '*'
                num_mines -= 1

        annotate(minefield)
        print('
'.join([''.join(row) for row in minefield]))

    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

```

### Example usage

Here is an example usage of the `board()` function:
```python
>>> board()
Enter number of rows: 5
Enter number of columns: 4
Enter number of mines: 3
·2**1
1*21*
12**1
·11·1
0*1·1
```

This will generate a 5x4 Minesweeper board with 3 randomly placed mines and display it to the user. The `annotate` function will count the adjacent mines and replace empty spaces with their respective counts.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in minesweeper.py to resolve the errors.
