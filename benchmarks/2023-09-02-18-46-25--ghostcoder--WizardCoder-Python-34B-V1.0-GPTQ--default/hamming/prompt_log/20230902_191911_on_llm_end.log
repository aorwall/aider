```python
def distance(strand_a, strand_b):
    """Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands."""
    if len(strand_a) != len(strand_b):
        raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(strand_a)):
        if strand_a[i] != strand_b[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```

The implementation is straightforward. We first check whether the lengths of the input strings are equal or not. If they are not equal, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful error message.
If they are equal, we iterate through each character in both strings using a loop and compare them. If there is a mismatch, we increment the counter by 1. Finally, we return the total number of differences found.
