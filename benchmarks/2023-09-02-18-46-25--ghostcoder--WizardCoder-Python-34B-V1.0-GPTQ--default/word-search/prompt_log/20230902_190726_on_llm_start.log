# Instructions

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last letter of each word.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_search.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here is an updated version of `word_search.py` with additional functionality for finding words in all four directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal-downwards, and diagonal-upwards) and returning their start and end positions:

This implementation uses the `__init__` method to store the puzzle as a list of lists and determine its dimensions (number of rows and columns). The `search` method then performs searches in four directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal downwards, and diagonal upwards.

The horizontal search is done by iterating over each row and using the `find()` method to find occurrences of the word. If found, it adds the starting and ending points to the result list.

The vertical search is similar but instead of iterating over rows, we iterate over columns and concatenate them into one string per column before searching.

For diagonal searches, we check if the word can be found in both forward and backward diagonals. We use slices to extract substrings from the puzzle and compare them with the given word.

Finally, the method returns the resulting list of tuples containing

I added a missing parenthesis on line 9 and fixed the indentation of lines 23 and 24. The code should now work as expected.
