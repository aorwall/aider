#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### ![Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/darts/darts-scoreboard.svg)  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Sure, here is the updated `darts.py` file:

```
def score(x, y):
  """
  Returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

  Args:
    x: The x-coordinate of the dart landing.
    y: The y-coordinate of the dart landing.

  Returns:
    The number of points earned by the dart.
  """

  # Calculate the distance from the dart landing to the center of the target.
  distance = ((x ** 2) + (y ** 2)) ** 0.5

  # If the dart lands outside the target, return 0 points.
  if distance > 10:
    return 0

  # Otherwise, return the appropriate number of points based on the dart's distance from the center of the target.
  if distance <= 1:
    return 10
  elif distance <= 5:
    return 5
  else:
    return 1
```
