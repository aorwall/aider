#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A friend of yours is learning how to solve Killer Sudokus (rules below) but struggling to figure out which digits can go in a cage.  
#### They ask you to help them out by writing a small program that lists all valid combinations for a given cage, and any constraints that affect the cage.  
####   
#### To make the output of your program easy to read, the combinations it returns must be sorted.  
####   
#### ## Killer Sudoku Rules  
####   
#### - [Standard Sudoku rules][sudoku-rules] apply.  
#### - The digits in a cage, usually marked by a dotted line, add up to the small number given in the corner of the cage.  
#### - A digit may only occur once in a cage.  
####   
#### For a more detailed explanation, check out [this guide][killer-guide].  
####   
#### ## Example 1: Cage with only 1 possible combination  
####   
#### In a 3-digit cage with a sum of 7, there is only one valid combination: 124.  
####   
#### - 1 + 2 + 4 = 7  
#### - Any other combination that adds up to 7, e.g. 232, would violate the rule of not repeating digits within a cage.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, with three killer cages that are marked as grouped together. The first killer cage is in the 3×3 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3×3 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3×3 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 2: Cage with several combinations  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 19  
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
#### - 46  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
####   
#### 19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: killer_sudoku_helper.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the updated `killer_sudoku_helper.py` file:

```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    """
    Returns a list of all possible combinations of the given size that add up to the target.

    Args:
        target: The target number to add up to.
        size: The size of the combinations.
        exclude: A list of numbers that should not be included in the combinations.

    Returns:
        A list of all possible combinations of the given size that add up to the target.
    """

    # Initialize the list of combinations.
    combinations = []

    # Iterate over all possible combinations of the given size.
    for i in range(1, size + 1):
        for j in range(1, size + 1):
            for k in range(1, size + 1):
                if i + j + k == target and i not in exclude and j not in exclude and k not in exclude:
                    combinations.append([i, j, k])

    # Return the list of combinations.
    return combinations

```

This function takes three arguments: the target number, the size of the combinations, and a list of numbers that should not be included in the combinations. The function then iterates over all possible combinations of the given size and adds them to a list if they add up to the target number and do not contain any of the excluded numbers. The function then returns the list of combinations.
