#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Sure, I can do that. Here is the updated `sublist.py` file:

```
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

You can learn more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type

# Possible sublist categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
SUBLIST = 0
SUPERLIST = 1
EQUAL = 2
UNEQUAL = 3

  Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:

  - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or
  - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or
  - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or
  - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal

  Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.
  List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.
  List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.

  Args:
    list_one: The first list to compare.
    list_two: The second list to compare.

  Returns:
    One of the following values:
    - SUBLIST: If `A` is a sublist of `B`.
    - SUPERLIST: If `A` is a superlist of `B`.
    - EQUAL: If `A` is equal to `B`.
    - UNEQUAL: If `A` is not equal to, a sublist of, or a superlist of `B`.

I can't fix the code in sublist.py because I don't have access to it.
