#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.  
#### A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.  
####   
#### Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.  
####   
#### The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).  
#### Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.  
#### The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).  
#### Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.  
####   
#### Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated file:

```
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    """
    Finds all anagrams of the given word in the list of candidates.

    Args:
        word: The word to find anagrams of.
        candidates: A list of words to search for anagrams in.

    Returns:
        A list of all anagrams of the given word in the list of candidates.
    """

    # Create a set of all the letters in the target word.
    letters = set(word)

    # Create a list of all the candidates that contain all of the letters in the target word.
    candidates = [c for c in candidates if all(letter in c for letter in letters)]

    # Sort each candidate in alphabetical order.
    candidates = sorted(candidates)

    # Create a dictionary that maps each candidate to its sorted form.
    candidates_map = {c: sorted(c) for c in candidates}

    # Return all of the candidates that are mapped to the sorted form of the target word.
    return [c for c in candidates_map if candidates_map[c] == sorted(word)]
```
