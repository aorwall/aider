#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.  
####   
#### [hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I think I understand the problem. Here is my solution:

```
import sys

class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.width = len(board[0])
        self.height = len(board)

    def get_winner(self):
        # Check if either player has won
        for player in ["O", "X"]:
            if self.is_winner(player):
                return player

        return None

    def is_winner(self, player):
        # Check if there is a path from the top to the bottom for the given player
        for i in range(self.height):
            if self.is_connected(player, i, 0):
                return True
            if self.is_connected(player, 0, i):
                return True

        return False

    def is_connected(self, player, row, col):
        # Check if there is a path from the given cell to the opposite side of the board for the given player
        if row == 0 or row == self.height - 1 or col == 0 or col == self.width - 1:
            return True

        if self.board[row][col] != player:
            return False

        for row_offset in [-1, 1]:
            for col_offset in [-1, 1]:
                if row + row_offset >= 0 and row + row_offset < self.height:
                    if col + col_offset >= 0 and col + col_offset < self.width:
                        if self.board[row + row_offset][col + col_offset] == player:
                            if self.is_connected(player, row + row_offset, col + col_offset):
                                return True

        return False
```

I hope this is what you were looking for.
