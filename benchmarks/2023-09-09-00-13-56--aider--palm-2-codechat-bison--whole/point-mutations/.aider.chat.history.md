#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.  
####   
#### A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or  
#### copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are  
#### vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect  
#### throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very  
#### rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,  
#### the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated  
#### result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.  
####   
#### The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point  
#### mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.  
####   
#### By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands  
#### taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of  
#### the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the  
#### evolutionary path between the two strands.  
####   
#### This is called the 'Hamming distance'  
####

####     CATCGTAATGACGGCCT  
####     ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^  
####   
#### The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.  
####   
#### ## Implementation notes  
####   
#### The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you  
#### may assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming  
#### distance function.  
####   
#### **Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: point_mutations.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
