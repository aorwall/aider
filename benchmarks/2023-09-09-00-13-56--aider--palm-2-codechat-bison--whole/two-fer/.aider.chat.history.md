#### # Introduction  
####   
#### In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".  
#### Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.  
#### So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.  
####   
#### Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").  
#### You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.  
####   
#### If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### One for Do-yun, one for me.  
#### ```  
####   
#### If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.  
#### Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### One for you, one for me.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Here are some examples:  
####   
#### | Name   | Dialogue                    |  
#### | :----- | :-------------------------- |  
#### | Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |  
#### | Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |  
#### |        | One for you, one for me.    |  
#### | Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two_fer.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I think I understand the task. Here is the updated `two_fer.py` file:

```
def two_fer(name):
  """Returns a string saying what to say when giving away an extra cookie.

  Args:
    name: The name of the person you are giving the cookie to.

  Returns:
    A string saying what to say.
  """

  if name is None:
    return "One for you, one for me."
  else:
    return "One for {} one for me.".format(name)
```

> Applied edit to two_fer.py
