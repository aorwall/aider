#### # Introduction  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### Like the previous `Resistor Color Duo` and `Resistor Color Trio` exercises, you will be translating resistor color bands to human-readable labels.  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### - Each band acts as a digit of a number.  
####   For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.  
#### The color bands are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.  
#### For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.  
#### In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.  
#### Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.  
#### For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.  
####   
#### The tolerance band will have one of these values:  
####   
#### - Grey - 0.05%  
#### - Violet - 0.1%  
#### - Blue - 0.25%  
#### - Green - 0.5%  
#### - Brown - 1%  
#### - Red - 2%  
#### - Gold - 5%  
#### - Silver - 10%  
####   
#### The four-band resistor is built up like this:  
####   
#### | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |  
#### | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |  
#### | Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |  
####   
#### Meaning  
####   
#### - orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.  
#### - orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.  
####   
#### The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.  
####   
#### | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |  
#### | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |  
#### | Value_1 | Value_2 | Value_3 | Multiplier | Tolerance |  
####   
#### Meaning  
####   
#### - orange-orange-orange-black-green would be 333 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.  
#### - orange-red-orange-blue-violet would be 323M ohms with a ±0.10 tolerance.  
####   
#### There are also one band resistors.  
#### One band resistors only have the color black with a value of 0.  
####   
#### This exercise is about translating the resistor band colors into a label:  
####   
#### "... ohms ...%"  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "black", "green" should return:  
####   
#### "33 ohms ±0.5%"  
####   
#### When there are more than a thousand ohms, we say "kiloohms".  
####  That's similar to saying "kilometer" for 1000 meters, and "kilograms" for 1000 grams.  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", "grey" should return:  
####   
#### "33 kiloohms ±0.05%"  
####   
#### When there are more than a million ohms, we say "megaohms".  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "blue", "red" should return:  
####   
#### "33 megaohms ±2%"  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_expert.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated code for `resistor_color_expert.py`:

```python
def resistor_label(colors):
  """Translates resistor color bands to a human-readable label.

  The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value,
  in ohms.

  The color bands are encoded as follows:

  - Black: 0
  - Brown: 1
  - Red: 2
  - Orange: 3
  - Yellow: 4
  - Green: 5
  - Blue: 6
  - Violet: 7
  - Grey: 8
  - White: 9

  In this exercise you will need to add tolerance to the mix.
  Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main
  value.
  For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.

  The tolerance band will have one of these values:

  - Grey - 0.05%
  - Violet - 0.1%
  - Blue - 0.25%
  - Green - 0.5%
  - Brown - 1%
  - Red - 2%
  - Gold - 5%
  - Silver - 10%

  The four-band resistor is built up like this:

  | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |
  | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
  | Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

  Meaning

  - orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
  - orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.

  The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band
  resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.

  | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |
  | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
  | Value_1 | Value_
