#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).  
#### Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.  
#### However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).  
####   
#### Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.  
#### Note that Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Limit: 10  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
####   
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated `knapsack.py` file:

```
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    """
    This function returns the maximum value that can be
    obtained by taking a subset of the items in the list
    such that the total weight of the subset does not
    exceed the maximum weight.

    Args:
        maximum_weight: The maximum weight that the knapsack
            can hold.
        items: A list of items, where each item is a
            dictionary with the following keys:
                - weight: The weight of the item.
                - value: The value of the item.

    Returns:
        The maximum value that can be obtained by taking a
        subset of the items in the list such that the total
        weight of the subset does not exceed the maximum
        weight.
    """

    # Initialize the table of values.
    table = [[0 for _ in range(maximum_weight + 1)] for _ in range(len(items) + 1)]

    # Populate the table.
    for i in range(1, len(items) + 1):
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight + 1):
            if items[i - 1]["weight"] <= j:
                table[i][j] = max(
                    table[i - 1][j],
                    table[i - 1][j - items[i - 1]["weight"]] + items[i - 1]["value"],
                )
            else:
                table[i][j] = table[i - 1][j]

    # Return the maximum value.
    return table[-1][-1]
