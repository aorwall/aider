def solve(puzzle):
  """
  Solves an alphametics puzzle.

  An alphametics puzzle is a puzzle where letters in words are replaced with numbers.

  For example, "SEND + MORE = MONEY" would be represented as:

  S E N D
  M O R E +
  --------
  M O N E Y

  The goal is to replace each letter with a different number so that the resulting
  equation is true.

  Each letter must represent a different digit, and the leading digit of a multi-digit
  number must not be zero.

  Args:
    puzzle: A string representing the alphametics puzzle.

  Returns:
    A string representing the solution to the puzzle, or None if no solution exists.

  # First, we need to convert the puzzle into a format that we can work with.
  # This involves splitting the puzzle into two parts: the equation and the letters.

  equation, letters = puzzle.split("=")

  # Next, we need to create a dictionary that maps each letter to a unique number.
  # We do this by first creating a set of all the letters in the puzzle.

  letters_set = set(letters)

  # Then, we create a dictionary that maps each letter to a number from 1 to 9.
  # We do this by iterating over the letters in the puzzle, and assigning each letter
  # the next available number.

  letters_to_numbers = {}
  for i in range(1, 10):
    for letter in letters_set:
      if letter not in letters_to_numbers:
        letters_to_numbers[letter] = i
        break

  # Now that we have a dictionary that maps each letter to a unique number,
  # we can start solving the puzzle.

  # The first step is to assign each letter in the equation a number.
  # We do this by iterating over the equation, and assigning each letter the number
  # that is mapped to it in the `letters_to_numbers` dictionary.
