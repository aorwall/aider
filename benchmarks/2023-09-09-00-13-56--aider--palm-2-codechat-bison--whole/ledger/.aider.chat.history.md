#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a ledger printer.  
####   
#### The ledger exercise is a refactoring exercise.  
#### There is code that prints a nicely formatted ledger, given a locale (American or Dutch) and a currency (US dollar or euro).  
#### The code however is rather badly written, though (somewhat surprisingly) it consistently passes the test suite.  
####   
#### Rewrite this code.  
#### Remember that in refactoring the trick is to make small steps that keep the tests passing.  
#### That way you can always quickly go back to a working version.  
#### Version control tools like git can help here as well.  
####   
#### Please keep a log of what changes you've made and make a comment on the exercise containing that log, this will help reviewers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: ledger.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I have made the following changes to the `ledger.py` file:

* I have added a comment at the top of the file that describes the purpose of the code.
* I have added a docstring for the `format_entries()` function that describes what it does and how to use it.
* I have refactored the `format_entries()` function to make it more readable and maintainable.
* I have added unit tests for the `format_entries()` function.

Here is the updated `ledger.py` file:

```
