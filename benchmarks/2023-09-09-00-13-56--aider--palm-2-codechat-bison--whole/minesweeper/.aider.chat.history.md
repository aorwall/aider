#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.  
####   
#### Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.  
####   
#### In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.  
####   
#### The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.  
#### A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.  
####   
#### If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ·*·*·  
#### ··*··  
#### ··*··  
#### ·····  
#### ```  
####   
#### And your code will transform it into this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 1*3*1  
#### 13*31  
#### ·2*2·  
#### ·111·  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()` function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the board receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: minesweeper.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated `minesweeper.py` file:

```python

  Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

  In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.

  The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.
  A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.

              mine_count += 1

        # Replace the empty square with the mine count.
        annotated_board[row][column] = str(mine_count)

  # Return the annotated board.
