#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An [Armstrong number][armstrong-number] is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`  
#### - 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`  
#### - 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`  
#### - 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`  
####   
#### Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: armstrong_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated file:

```
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    """
    Returns True if the given number is an Armstrong number.

    An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

    For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

    Args:
        number: The number to check.

    Returns:
        True if the number is an Armstrong number, False otherwise.
    """

    # Get the number of digits in the given number.
    num_digits = len(str(number))

    # Calculate the sum of the digits of the given number, each raised to the power of the number of digits.
    sum_of_digits = 0
    for digit in str(number):
        sum_of_digits += int(digit) ** num_digits

    # Return True if the sum of the digits is equal to the given number.
    return number == sum_of_digits
