#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  
####   
#### Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets.  
#### They start with prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public keys, and then generate a shared secret key.  
####   
#### ## Step 0  
####   
#### The test program supplies prime numbers p and g.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### Alice picks a private key, a, greater than 1 and less than p.  
#### Bob does the same to pick a private key b.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Alice calculates a public key A.  
####   
####     A = gᵃ mod p  
####   
#### Using the same p and g, Bob similarly calculates a public key B from his private key b.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Alice and Bob exchange public keys.  
#### Alice calculates secret key s.  
####   
####     s = Bᵃ mod p  
####   
#### Bob calculates  
####   
####     s = Aᵇ mod p  
####   
#### The calculations produce the same result!  
#### Alice and Bob now share secret s.  
#### # Should I use random or secrets?  
####   
#### Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.  
####   
#### The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate  
#### true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness.  
#### Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.  
####   
#### The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used,  
#### precisely because it is pseudo-random.  
####   
#### For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates  
#### cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.  
####   
#### Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but note that **it would be  
#### very insecure if actually used for cryptography.**  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diffie_hellman.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated `diffie_hellman.py` file:

```
import random

def private_key(p):
  """Generates a private key between 1 and p-1.

  Args:
    p: A prime number.

  Returns:
    A private key.

  # Generate a random number between 1 and p-1.
  private = random.randint(1, p - 1)

  # Return the private key.
  return private


def public_key(p, g, private):
  """Generates a public key from a private key.

  Args:

  # Calculate the public key.
  public = pow(g, private, p)

  # Return the public key.
  return public


def secret(p, public, private):
  """Generates a shared secret from a public key and a private key.
