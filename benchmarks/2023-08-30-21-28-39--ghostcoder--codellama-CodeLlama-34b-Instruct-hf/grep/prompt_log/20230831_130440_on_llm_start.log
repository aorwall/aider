Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Search files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.

The Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.
Your task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.

The `grep` command takes three arguments:

1. The string to search for.
2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.
3. One or more files to search in.

It then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.
When searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').

## Flags

The `grep` command supports the following flags:

- `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).
- `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.
- `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.
- `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grep.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have modified the `grep.py` file to implement the `grep` command with the specified flags. Here is the updated file:</s>
<s>[INST]Filepath: grep.py
```python
def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    """

        flags (list[str]): Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.
        files (list[str]): One or more files to search in.
    
    Returns:

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grep.py to resolve the errors.
