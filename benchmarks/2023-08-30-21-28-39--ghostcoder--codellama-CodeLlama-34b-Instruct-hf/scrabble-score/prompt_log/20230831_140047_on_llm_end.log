 The issue with the code is that it is not properly handling the case where the input word contains letters that are not in the `letter_values` dictionary. In this case, the code is returning 0 for the score, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, you can add a check to see if the letter is in the `letter_values` dictionary before trying to access its value. If the letter is not in the dictionary, you can return a score of 0 for that letter.

Here is an updated version of the `score` function that should resolve the testing errors:
```python
def score(word):
    # Initialize the score to 0
    score = 0

    # Iterate through each letter in the word
    for letter in word:
        # Check if the letter is in the dictionary
        if letter in letter_values:
            # Add the value of the letter to the score
            score += letter_values[letter]
        else:
            # If the letter is not in the dictionary, return a score of 0 for that letter
            score += 0

    # Return the final score
    return score
```
With this updated code, the tests should now pass.
