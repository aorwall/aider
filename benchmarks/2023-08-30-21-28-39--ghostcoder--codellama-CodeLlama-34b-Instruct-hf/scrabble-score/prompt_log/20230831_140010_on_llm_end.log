Explanation:

I added a new function called `score` that takes a word as an argument and calculates the Scrabble score for that word. The function uses a dictionary called `letter_values` to keep track of the point value for each letter. The function iterates through each letter in the word and checks if the letter is in the dictionary. If it is, the function adds the value of the letter to the score. Finally, the function returns the final score.

I also added a dictionary called `letter_values` that contains the point value for each letter. The dictionary is used in the `score` function to determine the point value for each letter in the word.

I kept the existing function or class stubs and implemented the new function `score` based on the instructions provided. I did not implement or change any unit tests.
