 I have modified the `resistor_color.py` file to include the `color_code` function and the `colors` function.

Here is the updated file:
```
def color_code(color):
    color_map = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    return color_map[color]

def colors():
    return ["black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white"]
```
I have also added a `color_map` dictionary to the `color_code` function to map the color names to their corresponding numerical values.

The `colors` function simply returns a list of all the color names.

I have not changed any unit tests, as instructed.
