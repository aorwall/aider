Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language

```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.

To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

- to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
- to list the different band colors

Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:
Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.

More information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
