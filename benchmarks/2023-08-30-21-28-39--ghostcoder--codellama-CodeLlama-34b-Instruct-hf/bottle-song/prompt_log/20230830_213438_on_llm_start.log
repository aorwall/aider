Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.

Note that not all verses are identical.

```text
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.

Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.

Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.

Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.

Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.

Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.

Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.

Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.

Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.

One green bottle hanging on the wall,
One green bottle hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I updated a file.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bottle_song.py to resolve the errors.
