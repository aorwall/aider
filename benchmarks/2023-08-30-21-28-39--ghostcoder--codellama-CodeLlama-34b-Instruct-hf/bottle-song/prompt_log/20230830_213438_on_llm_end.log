Explanation:
In the `recite` function, we initialize an empty list called `verses` and then use a for-loop to iterate over the range of numbers from `start` to `start - take` in descending order. For each iteration, we call the `verse` function with the current number as an argument and append the returned string to the `verses` list. Finally, we return the `verses` list.

In the `verse` function, we use a series of if-else statements to handle the different cases for the number of green bottles. For the first two cases, we return a hardcoded string for the specific number of bottles. For the general case, we use an f-string to construct the string with the correct number of bottles.

Note that we have kept the existing function and class stubs in the `bottle_song.py` file, and only implemented the missing functionality.
