 Filepath: reverse_string.py
```python
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]
```
Explanation:
In the reverse function, we use slicing to get the characters of the input string in reverse order. The [::-1] syntax tells Python to start at the end of the string and move backwards to the beginning, stepping backwards by 1 character each time. This creates a new string with the characters in reverse order, which is then returned as the result of the function.
I updated the existing file.
