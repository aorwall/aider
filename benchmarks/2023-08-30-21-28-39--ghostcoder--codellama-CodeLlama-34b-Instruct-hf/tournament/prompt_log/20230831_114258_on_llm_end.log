 The issue with the code is that it is not handling the case where a team wins a match but loses another match. In the `tally` function, the `points` dictionary is only keeping track of the number of wins and draws, but not the number of losses.

To fix this, we need to add a variable to keep track of the number of losses for each team. We can do this by adding a new variable `losses` to the `teams` dictionary, and then incrementing it for each loss.

Here's the updated code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def tally(rows):
    teams = defaultdict(list)
    for row in rows:
        team1, team2, outcome = row.split(';')
        teams[team1].append(outcome)
        teams[team2].append(outcome)

    points = {}
    for team, matches in teams.items():
        wins = matches.count('win')
        draws = matches.count('draw')
        losses = matches.count('loss')
        points[team] = wins * 3 + draws

    return sorted(points.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
```
With this updated code, the tests should now pass.
