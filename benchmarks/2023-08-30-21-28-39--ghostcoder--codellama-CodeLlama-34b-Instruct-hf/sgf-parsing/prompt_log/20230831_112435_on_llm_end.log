 The errors in the tests are due to the fact that the `parse` function in `sgf_parsing.py` is not implemented. The function is supposed to take a string as input and return an `SgfTree` object, but it is currently not doing anything.

To fix the errors, you need to implement the `parse` function in `sgf_parsing.py`. The function should parse the input string and create an `SgfTree` object based on the contents of the string.

Here is an example of how you could implement the `parse` function:
```
def parse(input_string):
    # Create an empty SgfTree object
    tree = SgfTree()

    # Split the input string into lines
    lines = input_string.splitlines()

    # Iterate over the lines and parse the properties and children
    for line in lines:
        # Split the line into key-value pairs
        key, value = line.split("[", 1)
        key = key.strip()
        value = value.strip()

        # Add the property to the tree
        tree.properties[key] = value

        # Check if the line has children
        if "(" in value:
            # Split the value into children
            children = value.split("(")

            # Add the children to the tree
            for child in children:
                tree.children.append(SgfTree(properties={child.strip(): None}))

    return tree
```
This implementation assumes that the input string is in the format of an SGF file, with each line representing a property or a child node. The function splits the input string into lines, and then iterates over each line to parse the properties and children. It adds the properties to the `properties` dictionary of the `SgfTree` object, and adds the children to the `children` list of the `SgfTree` object.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
