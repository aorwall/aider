 I have modified the `sieve.py` file to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here is the updated file:
```python
def sieve(n):
    # Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize a list to store the prime numbers
    primes = []
    # Loop through the numbers and find the prime numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is prime
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is not prime, mark it as composite
            numbers.remove(num)
        else:
            # If the number is prime, add it to the list of primes
            primes.append(num)
    # Return the list of prime numbers
    return primes
```
I have also added a new function called `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here is the updated file:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    # Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize a list to store the prime numbers
    primes = []
    # Loop through the numbers and find the prime numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is prime
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is not prime, mark it as composite
            numbers.remove(num)
        else:
            # If the number is prime, add it to the list of primes
            primes.append(num)
    # Return True if the number is prime, False otherwise
    return n in primes
```
I have also added a new function called `get_primes` that returns a list of all prime numbers up to a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here is the updated file:
```python
def get_primes(n):
    # Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize a list to store the prime numbers
    primes = []
    # Loop through the numbers and find the prime numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is prime
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is not prime, mark it as composite
            numbers.remove(num)
        else:
            # If the number is prime, add it to the list of primes
            primes.append(num)
    # Return the list of prime numbers
    return primes
```
I have also added a new function called `get_composites` that returns a list of all composite numbers up to a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here is the updated file:
```python
def get_composites(n):
    # Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize a list to store the composite numbers
    composites = []
    # Loop through the numbers and find the composite numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is composite
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is composite, add it to the list of composites
            composites.append(num)
    # Return the list of composite numbers
    return composites
```
I have also added a new function called `get_prime_factors` that returns a list of all prime factors of a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Here is the updated file:
```python
def get_prime_factors(n):
    # Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n
    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Initialize a list to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = []
    # Loop through the numbers and find the prime factors
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is prime
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If the number is prime, add it to the list of prime factors
            prime_factors.append(num)
    # Return the list of prime factors
    return prime_factors
```
