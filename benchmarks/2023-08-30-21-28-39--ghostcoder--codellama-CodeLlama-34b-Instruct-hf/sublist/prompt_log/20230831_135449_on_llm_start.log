Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:

- List `A` is equal to list `B`; or
- List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or
- List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or
- None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal

Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.
List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.
List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.

Examples:

- If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have modified the `sublist.py` file to implement the `sublist` function as per the instructions. Here is the updated file:</s>
<s>[INST]Filepath: sublist.py
```python
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

You can learn more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type

# Possible sublist categories.

SUPERLIST = 1
EQUAL = 2
UNEQUAL = 3

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in sublist.py to resolve the errors.
