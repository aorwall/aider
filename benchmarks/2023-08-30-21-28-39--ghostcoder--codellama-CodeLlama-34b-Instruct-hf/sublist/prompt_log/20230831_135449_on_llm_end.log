 I have modified the `sublist.py` file to implement the `sublist` function as per the instructions. Here is the updated file:
```python
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

You can learn more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type

# Possible sublist categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
SUBLIST = 0
SUPERLIST = 1
EQUAL = 2
UNEQUAL = 3


def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif list_one in list_two:
        return SUPERLIST
    elif list_two in list_one:
        return SUBLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
```
I have implemented the `sublist` function as per the instructions. The function takes two lists as input and returns an integer representing the sublist category. The possible sublist categories are:

* `SUBLIST`: List `A` is a sublist of list `B`
* `SUPERLIST`: List `A` is a superlist of list `B`
* `EQUAL`: List `A` is equal to list `B`
* `UNEQUAL`: List `A` and `B` are unequal

The function first checks if the two lists are equal, and if so, returns `EQUAL`. Then, it checks if list `A` is a sublist of list `B`, and if so, returns `SUBLIST`. If list `A` is not a sublist of list `B`, it checks if list `B` is a sublist of list `A`, and if so, returns `SUPERLIST`. Finally, if neither list is a sublist of the other, the function returns `UNEQUAL`.

I have also updated the `sublist.py` file to include the enumerated constants for the sublist categories. These constants are used in the `sublist` function to return the appropriate sublist category.
