 The issue with the code is that the enumerated constants are not being used correctly. The `SUBLIST`, `SUPERLIST`, `EQUAL`, and `UNEQUAL` constants are defined, but they are not being used in the `sublist` function. Instead, the function is returning the integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3, which are not the same as the constants.

To fix the issue, the `sublist` function should be updated to use the enumerated constants instead of the integer values. For example, the function should return `SUBLIST` instead of 0, `SUPERLIST` instead of 1, `EQUAL` instead of 2, and `UNEQUAL` instead of 3.

Here is the updated code with the enumerated constants used correctly:
```python
# Possible sublist categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
SUBLIST = 0
SUPERLIST = 1
EQUAL = 2
UNEQUAL = 3


def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif list_one in list_two:
        return SUPERLIST
    elif list_two in list_one:
        return SUBLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
```
With these changes, the tests should now pass.
