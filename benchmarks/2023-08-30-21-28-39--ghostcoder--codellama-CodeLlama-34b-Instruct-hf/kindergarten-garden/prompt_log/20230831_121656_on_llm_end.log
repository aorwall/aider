####

The above implementation defines a `Garden` class that takes a `diagram` and an optional `students` list as arguments.
The `diagram` is a string representing the garden layout, where each character represents a plant type (Violets, Radishes, Clover, or Grass).
The `students` list is a list of student names, which defaults to the 12 students mentioned in the problem statement if not provided.

The `__init__()` method initializes the `student_plants` dictionary, which maps each student to a list of plants they are responsible for.
It then parses the `diagram` and populates the `student_plants` dictionary based on the plant types and student assignments.

The `plants()` method returns the list of plants for a given student.

The implementation follows the instructions provided in the problem statement and passes all the unit tests.
