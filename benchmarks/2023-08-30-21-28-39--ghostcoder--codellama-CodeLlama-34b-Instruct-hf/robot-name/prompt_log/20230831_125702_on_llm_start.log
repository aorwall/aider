Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] To ensure that every existing robot has a unique name, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the names that have been assigned. When a new robot is created, we can generate a random name and check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it does, we can generate a new name until we find one that doesn't exist.

Here's an example of how we can modify the `Robot` class to keep track of the names:</s>
<s>[INST]Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        self.name_dict = {}

    def generate_name(self):
        while True:
            name = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(2)) + ''.join(random.choice(string.digits) for _ in range(3))
            if name not in self.name_dict:
                self.name_dict[name] = True
                break
        self.name = name

    def reset(self):
        self.name = None
        self.name_dict = {}

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_name.py to resolve the errors.
