 To ensure that every existing robot has a unique name, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the names that have been assigned. When a new robot is created, we can generate a random name and check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it does, we can generate a new name until we find one that doesn't exist.

Here's an example of how we can modify the `Robot` class to keep track of the names:
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        self.name_dict = {}

    def generate_name(self):
        while True:
            name = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(2)) + ''.join(random.choice(string.digits) for _ in range(3))
            if name not in self.name_dict:
                self.name_dict[name] = True
                break
        self.name = name

    def reset(self):
        self.name = None
        self.name_dict = {}
```
In this implementation, we've added a `name_dict` attribute to the `Robot` class, which is a dictionary that keeps track of the names that have been assigned. When a new robot is created, we generate a random name and check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it does, we generate a new name until we find one that doesn't exist.

We've also added a `reset` method that clears the `name` and `name_dict` attributes when the robot is reset.

With these changes, the `Robot` class now ensures that every existing robot has a unique name, and the risk of collisions is minimized.
