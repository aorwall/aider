 The issue with the code in `isogram.py` is that the `is_isogram` function is not implemented. The function is defined, but it does not contain any code to check if a string is an isogram or not.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the logic to check if a string is an isogram or not. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    # Check if the string contains any duplicate characters
    for char in string:
        if string.count(char) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```
This implementation uses the `count` method of the string to check if any character in the string appears more than once. If any character appears more than once, the function returns `False`, indicating that the string is not an isogram. If no duplicate characters are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is an isogram.

With this implementation, the tests in `isogram_test.py` should pass.
