Explanation:

The `score` function takes two arguments `x` and `y`, which represent the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the target. The function first calculates the distance of the point from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem.

Then, it checks if the distance is greater than 10, which means the point is outside the target. If it is, the function returns 0 points.

Next, it checks if the distance is greater than 5, which means the point is in the outer circle. If it is, the function returns 1 point.

Then, it checks if the distance is greater than 1, which means the point is in the middle circle. If it is, the function returns 5 points.

Finally, if the distance is less than or equal to 1, the point is in the inner circle, and the function returns 10 points.

The function uses a series of `elif` statements to check the distance and return the correct number of points. The `elif` statements are used instead of `if` statements to avoid unnecessary checks. For example, if the distance is greater than 10, there is no need to check if it is greater than 5 or 1, because we already know it is greater than 10.

The function returns the correct number of points for any given point on the target, following the rules of the game.
