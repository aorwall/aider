 The issue is that the `score` function is not implemented. It is defined as `pass` which means it does nothing.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `score` function. Here is an example implementation:
```python
def score(x, y):
    if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
        return 10
    elif x**2 + y**2 <= 25:
        return 5
    else:
        return 1
```
This implementation checks the distance of the point from the center of the circle. If the distance is less than or equal to 1, it returns 10. If the distance is less than or equal to 25, it returns 5. Otherwise, it returns 1.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
