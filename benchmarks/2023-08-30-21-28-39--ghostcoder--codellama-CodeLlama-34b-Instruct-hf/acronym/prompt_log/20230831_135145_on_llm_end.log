```python
def abbreviate(words):
    return ''.join([word[0] for word in words.split()])

```
Explanation:
In the abbreviate function, we first split the input string into a list of words using the split() method. Then, we iterate over each word and extract the first letter using the indexing operator [0]. Finally, we join the list of first letters into a string using the join() method.

Note that we have not modified the existing function or class stubs, as instructed in the instructions. We have only implemented the missing functionality in the abbreviate function.
