 Here is the modified file:
Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.isupper():
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Sure."
    elif hey_bob.strip() == "":
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```
Explanation:
I modified the `response` function to check if the input `hey_bob` is in uppercase, ends with a question mark, or is empty. Based on these conditions, it returns the appropriate response.

Note that I kept the existing function signature and docstring, and only modified the implementation.
