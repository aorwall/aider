```python
def count_rectangles(diagram):
    rectangles = 0
    for line in diagram.splitlines():
        if line.startswith("+"):
            rectangles += 1
    return rectangles

```
Explanation:
In the count_rectangles function, we first split the diagram into individual lines using the splitlines() method. We then iterate over each line and check if it starts with a "+" character. If it does, we increment the rectangles counter by 1. Finally, we return the total number of rectangles found.

Note that we have kept the existing function stub and implemented the function according to the instructions provided. We have also used the splitlines() method to split the diagram into individual lines, which is a standard Python method.
