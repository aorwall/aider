 The issue with the code is that the `rectangles` function is not returning anything. In the `count_rectangles` function, the `rectangles` variable is incremented for each line that starts with a `+`, but the function does not return the value of `rectangles`.

To fix the issue, you can simply add a `return rectangles` statement at the end of the `count_rectangles` function, like this:
```python
def count_rectangles(diagram):
    rectangles = 0
    for line in diagram.splitlines():
        if line.startswith("+"):
            rectangles += 1
    return rectangles
```
This will ensure that the `rectangles` function returns the correct number of rectangles in the input diagram.
