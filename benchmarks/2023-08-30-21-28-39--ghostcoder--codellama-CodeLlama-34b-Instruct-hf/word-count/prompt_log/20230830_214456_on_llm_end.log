 The issue with the code is that it is not handling the punctuation and special characters correctly. The `split()` method is not able to split the words correctly because of the punctuation and special characters.

To fix this issue, you can use the `re` module in Python to split the words based on the word boundaries. Here's an example of how you can modify the `count_words()` function to handle punctuation and special characters correctly:
```python
import re

def count_words(sentence):
    words = re.split(r'\W+', sentence)
    word_counts = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] = 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] += 1
    return word_counts
```
In this modified version of the `count_words()` function, we use the `re.split()` method to split the words based on the word boundaries. The `\W+` pattern matches any non-word character (such as punctuation or special characters) and splits the sentence on those characters.

With this modification, the tests should now pass correctly.
