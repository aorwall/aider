 The issue is that the `verse` function is not properly formatting the output for the first and last verses.

In the first verse, the output should be "On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree."

In the last verse, the output should be "On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming."

To fix this, you can modify the `verse` function to include a special case for the first and last verses:
```python
def verse(n):
    gifts = ["a Partridge in a Pear Tree", "two Turtle Doves", "three French Hens", "four Calling Birds", "five Gold Rings", "six Geese-a-Laying", "seven Swans-a-Swimming", "eight Maids-a-Milking", "nine Ladies Dancing", "ten Lords-a-Leaping", "eleven Pipers Piping", "twelve Drummers Drumming"]
    if n == 1:
        return "On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: " + gifts[0]
    elif n == 12:
        return "On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: " + gifts[11]
    else:
        return "On the " + str(n) + "th day of Christmas my true love gave to me: " + ", ".join(gifts[:n])
```
This will ensure that the output for the first and last verses is correct.
