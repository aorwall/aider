 I have modified the `dnd_character.py` file to include a function called `roll_dice` that takes a number of dice and a number of sides as arguments and returns the sum of the highest three dice. I have also added a function called `generate_character` that uses the `roll_dice` function to generate a character with six abilities and hitpoints.

Here is the updated `dnd_character.py` file:
```
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.abilities = {
            "strength": 0,
            "dexterity": 0,
            "constitution": 0,
            "intelligence": 0,
            "wisdom": 0,
            "charisma": 0
        }
        self.hitpoints = 0

    def roll_dice(self, num_dice, num_sides):
        rolls = []
        for i in range(num_dice):
            rolls.append(random.randint(1, num_sides))
        rolls.sort()
        return sum(rolls[-3:])

    def generate_character(self):
        for ability in self.abilities:
            self.abilities[ability] = self.roll_dice(4, 6)
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.abilities["constitution"] // 2

# Test the generate_character function
character = Character()
character.generate_character()
print(character.abilities)
print(character.hitpoints)
```
The `roll_dice` function takes two arguments: `num_dice` and `num_sides`. It generates a list of `num_dice` random integers between 1 and `num_sides`, sorts the list, and returns the sum of the three highest values.

The `generate_character` function uses the `roll_dice` function to generate six abilities and hitpoints for the character. It first initializes the abilities to 0, then loops through each ability and sets its value to the result of calling `roll_dice` with 4 and 6. Finally, it calculates the hitpoints by adding 10 to the constitution modifier, which is calculated by dividing the constitution ability by 2 and rounding down.

I have also added a test function at the end of the file to demonstrate how the `generate_character` function can be used.
