The errors in the test cases are caused by the fact that the `from_tree` method is not defined in the `Zipper` class.

To fix the error, you need to add the `from_tree` method to the `Zipper` class.



Here is an example of how the `from_tree` method could look like:
```
def from_tree(self, tree):
 

self.tree = tree





self.focus = tree
return self
```
