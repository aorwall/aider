Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Creating a zipper for a binary tree.

[Zippers][zipper] are a purely functional way of navigating within a data structure and manipulating it.
They essentially contain a data structure and a pointer into that data structure (called the focus).

For example given a rose tree (where each node contains a value and a list of child nodes) a zipper might support these operations:

- `from_tree` (get a zipper out of a rose tree, the focus is on the root node)
- `to_tree` (get the rose tree out of the zipper)
- `value` (get the value of the focus node)
- `prev` (move the focus to the previous child of the same parent,
  returns a new zipper)
- `next` (move the focus to the next child of the same parent, returns a
  new zipper)
- `up` (move the focus to the parent, returns a new zipper)
- `set_value` (set the value of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_before` (insert a new subtree before the focus node, it
  becomes the `prev` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_after` (insert a new subtree after the focus node, it becomes
  the `next` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `delete` (removes the focus node and all subtrees, focus moves to the
  `next` node if possible otherwise to the `prev` node if possible,
  otherwise to the parent node, returns a new zipper)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: zipper.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
