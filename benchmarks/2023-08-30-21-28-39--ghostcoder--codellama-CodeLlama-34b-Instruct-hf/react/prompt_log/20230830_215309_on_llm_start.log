Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Implement a basic reactive system.

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how values are computed in terms of each other to allow a change to one value to automatically propagate to other values, like in a spreadsheet.

Implement a basic reactive system with cells with settable values ("input" cells) and cells with values computed in terms of other cells ("compute" cells).
Implement updates so that when an input value is changed, values propagate to reach a new stable system state.

In addition, compute cells should allow for registering change notification callbacks.
Call a cell’s callbacks when the cell’s value in a new stable state has changed from the previous stable state.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: react.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
