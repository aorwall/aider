 Filepath: accumulate.py
```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    return [operation(x) for x in collection]
```
Explanation:
In the `accumulate` function, we use a list comprehension to apply the `operation` function to each element in the `collection`. The resulting list is returned as the output.

Note: The `operation` function is a higher-order function, meaning it takes another function as an argument. In this case, it takes a function that squares a number.
