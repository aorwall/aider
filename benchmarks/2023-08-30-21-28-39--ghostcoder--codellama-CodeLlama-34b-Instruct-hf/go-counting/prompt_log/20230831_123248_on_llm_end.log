prompt:
 The error message indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in the test file `go_counting_test.py`. Specifically, it says that the name `WHITE` cannot be imported from the module `go_counting`.

Looking at the code in `go_counting.py`, we can see that there is no definition for `WHITE`. It seems that the test file is expecting a constant named `WHITE` to be defined in the `go_counting` module, but it is not.

To fix this issue, you can add the following line to the top of the `go_counting.py` file:
```python
WHITE = "W"
```
This will define the `WHITE` constant and make it available for import in the test file.

Alternatively, you can modify the test file to use the `W` constant instead of `WHITE`. For example:
```python
from go_counting import (
    Board,
    W,
)
```
This will import the `W` constant from the `go_counting` module and use it in the test file instead of `WHITE`.
