```python
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    return [x for x in sequence if predicate(x)]

def discard(sequence, predicate):
    return [x for x in sequence if not predicate(x)]
```
Explanation:
In the `keep` function, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the input sequence and check if the predicate is true for each element. If the predicate is true, we include the element in the resulting list.
In the `discard` function, we use the same list comprehension, but with the `not` operator to invert the predicate. This means that if the predicate is false, we include the element in the resulting list.

Note that the `keep` and `discard` functions are implemented using list comprehensions, which are a concise way to create lists in Python. The syntax is `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`. In this case, the expression is simply the element `x`, the iterable is the input sequence, and the condition is the predicate.

Also note that the `keep` and `discard` functions are pure functions, meaning they have no side effects and always return the same output given the same inputs. This makes them easy to test and reason about.
