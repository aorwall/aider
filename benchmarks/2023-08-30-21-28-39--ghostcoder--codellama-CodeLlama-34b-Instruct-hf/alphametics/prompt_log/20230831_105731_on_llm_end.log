Explanation:
In this solution, we first convert the puzzle into a list of words. We then create a dictionary to map letters to digits. We iterate through the words and digits, and for each letter, we check if it is already mapped. If it is, we continue to the next letter. If it is not, we try all possible values for the letter, and for each value, we check if it is valid for the current position, current word, and the entire puzzle. If the value is valid, we map the letter to the value and break out of the loop. Finally, we return the solved puzzle by joining the mapped letters.

Note that this solution assumes that the puzzle is valid and has a unique solution. If the puzzle is invalid or has multiple solutions, the function will return an incorrect result.
