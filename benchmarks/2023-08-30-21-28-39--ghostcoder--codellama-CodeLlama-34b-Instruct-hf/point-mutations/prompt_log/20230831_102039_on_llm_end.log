#####

The code you provided has several issues:

1. The function `hamming_distance` is not properly indented, which will cause a SyntaxError.
2. The function is not defined correctly. It should be defined as `def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):`
3. The function is not returning the correct value. It should return the number of differences between the two strands, not the length of the strands.
4. The function is not handling the case where the strands are of different lengths. It should raise a ValueError in this case.

Here is an example of how the function could be implemented correctly:
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")
    distance = 0
    for i in range(len(dna_strand_1)):
        if dna_strand_1[i] != dna_strand_2[i]:
            distance += 1
    return distance
```
This function will raise a ValueError if the strands are of different lengths, and will return the number of differences between the two strands if they are of equal length.
