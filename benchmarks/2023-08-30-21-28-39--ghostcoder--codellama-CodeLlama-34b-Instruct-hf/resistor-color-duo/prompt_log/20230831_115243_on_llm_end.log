 The issue is that the `value` function is not ignoring the additional colors passed in the list. The function should only consider the first two colors in the list and ignore the rest.

To fix this, you can modify the `value` function to only consider the first two colors in the list, like this:
```python
def value(colors):
    color_map = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    resistance = 0
    for color in colors[:2]:
        resistance = resistance * 10 + color_map[color]
    return resistance
```
This will ensure that the function only considers the first two colors in the list and ignores the rest.
