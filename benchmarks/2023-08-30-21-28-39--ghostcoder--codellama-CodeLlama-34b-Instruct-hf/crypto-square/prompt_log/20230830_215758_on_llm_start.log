Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.

First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.
These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

```text
"If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."
```

is normalized to:

```text
"ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"
```

The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.
The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.

If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:

- `r * c >= length of message`,
- and `c >= r`,
- and `c - r <= 1`.

Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:

```text
"ifmanwas"
"meanttos"
"tayonthe"
"groundgo"
"dwouldha"
"vegivenu"
"sroots  "
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.

The message above is coded as:

```text
"imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"
```

Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.
For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.

```text
"imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "
```

Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:

```text
"imtgdvs"
"fearwer"
"mayoogo"
"anouuio"
"ntnnlvt"
"wttddes"
"aohghn "
"sseoau "
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have updated the `crypto_square.py` file with the following changes:

1. Added a new function called `cipher_text` that takes a string as input and returns the encoded version of the string using the crypto square method.
2. Modified the existing `crypto_square` function to call the new `cipher_text` function and return the encoded text.

Here is the updated `crypto_square.py` file:
I updated a file.
Filepath: crypto_square.py
```python
def cipher_text(plain_text):
    # Normalize the input text
    normalized_text = plain_text.lower().replace(" ", "").replace(",", "").replace(".", "")

    # Calculate the number of rows and columns
    num_rows = int(len(normalized_text) ** 0.5)
    num_cols = int(len(normalized_text) / num_rows)

    # Create a list to store the encoded text
    encoded_text = []

    # Loop through each row and column
    for row in range(num_rows):
        for col in range(num_cols):
            # Get the character at the current position
            char = normalized_text[row * num_cols + col]

            # Add the character to the encoded text
            encoded_text.append(char)

    # Return the encoded text
    return "".join(encoded_text)

def crypto_square(plain_text):
    # Call the cipher_text function to get the encoded text
    encoded_text = cipher_text(plain_text)

    # Return the encoded text
    return encoded_text
