 The errors in the testing output indicate that the `MeteredFile` class is not properly implementing the context manager protocol. Specifically, the `read_bytes` and `read_ops` properties are not being set correctly, and the `write` method is not being called correctly.

To fix these errors, you can modify the `MeteredFile` class as follows:
```python
class MeteredFile(io.BufferedRandom):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.read_bytes = 0
        self.read_ops = 0
        self.write_bytes = 0
        self.write_ops = 0

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        pass

    def read(self, size=-1):
        data = super().read(size)
        self.read_bytes += len(data)
        self.read_ops += 1
        return data

    @property
    def read_bytes(self):
        return self.read_bytes

    @property
    def read_ops(self):
        return self.read_ops

    def write(self, b):
        super().write(b)
        self.write_bytes += len(b)
        self.write_ops += 1

    @property
    def write_bytes(self):
        return self.write_bytes

    @property
    def write_ops(self):
        return self.write_ops
```
With these changes, the `MeteredFile` class should now correctly implement the context manager protocol and the `read` and `write` methods should be called correctly. The `read_bytes` and `read_ops` properties should also be set correctly.

It's worth noting that the `MeteredFile` class is still not fully implemented, as it does not handle the case where the file is closed before it is fully read or written. You may want to add additional logic to handle this case.
