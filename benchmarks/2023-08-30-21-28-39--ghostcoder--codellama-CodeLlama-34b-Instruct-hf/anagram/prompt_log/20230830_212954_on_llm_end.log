Explanation:
In the `find_anagrams` function, we first create a dictionary `target_letter_count` to store the letter counts of the target word. We then iterate over the letters in the target word and update the dictionary accordingly.
Next, we create a list `anagrams` to store the anagrams found in the candidates.
We then iterate over the candidates and check if they are anagrams of the target word. For each candidate, we create a dictionary `candidate_letter_count` to store the letter counts of the candidate word. We then iterate over the letters in the candidate word and update the dictionary accordingly.
Finally, we check if the candidate word is an anagram of the target word by comparing the `target_letter_count` and `candidate_letter_count` dictionaries. If they are equal, we add the candidate word to the `anagrams` list.
The function returns the `anagrams` list at the end.
