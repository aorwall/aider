```python
def convert(number):
    result = ""
    if number % 3 == 0:
        result += "Pling"
    if number % 5 == 0:
        result += "Plang"
    if number % 7 == 0:
        result += "Plong"
    if result == "":
        result = str(number)
    return result
```
Explanation:
In the `convert` function, we first initialize an empty string `result`.
We then check if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or 7 using the modulo operator.
If the number is divisible by any of these factors, we add the corresponding raindrop sound to the `result` string.
If the number is not divisible by any of these factors, we simply convert the number to a string and assign it to `result`.
Finally, we return the `result` string.

Note that we have kept the existing function stubs and only modified the implementation of the `convert` function.
We have also used the modulo operator to check for factors, as per the instructions.
