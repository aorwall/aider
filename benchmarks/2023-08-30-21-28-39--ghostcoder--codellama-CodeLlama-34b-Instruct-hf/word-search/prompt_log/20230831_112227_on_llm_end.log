 I have modified the `word_search.py` file to implement the functionality described in the instructions. Here is the updated file:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y


class WordSearch:
    def __init__(self, puzzle):
        self.puzzle = puzzle

    def search(self, word):
        # Find the first letter of the word in the puzzle
        first_letter = word[0]
        for i in range(len(self.puzzle)):
            for j in range(len(self.puzzle[i])):
                if self.puzzle[i][j] == first_letter:
                    # Check if the word is hidden in the puzzle
                    # starting from the current position
                    if self.is_word_hidden(word, i, j):
                        return (i, j), (i + len(word) - 1, j + len(word) - 1)
        return None

    def is_word_hidden(self, word, i, j):
        # Check if the word is hidden in the puzzle
        # starting from the current position
        for k in range(len(word)):
            if self.puzzle[i + k][j + k] != word[k]:
                return False
        return True
```
I have added a new class `Point` to represent a point in the puzzle, and a new method `search` to the `WordSearch` class. The `search` method takes a word as input and returns the location of the first and last letter of the word in the puzzle, or `None` if the word is not found.

The `search` method first finds the first letter of the word in the puzzle and then checks if the word is hidden in the puzzle starting from the current position. If the word is found, the method returns the location of the first and last letter of the word. If the word is not found, the method returns `None`.

The `is_word_hidden` method is used to check if the word is hidden in the puzzle starting from the current position. It takes the word, the row and column of the current position as input and returns `True` if the word is hidden in the puzzle starting from the current position, and `False` otherwise.

I have also added some unit tests to the `word_search_test.py` file to test the `WordSearch` class. The tests check that the `search` method returns the correct location of the first and last letter of the word in the puzzle for different words and puzzles.
