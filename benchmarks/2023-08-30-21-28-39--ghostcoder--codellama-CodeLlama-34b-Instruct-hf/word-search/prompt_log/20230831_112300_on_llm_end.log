 The errors are caused by the fact that the `is_word_hidden` method is not properly handling the case where the word is not found in the puzzle. Specifically, when the method reaches the end of the puzzle and the word has not been found, it tries to access an index that is out of range.

To fix the errors, you can modify the `is_word_hidden` method to check if the word has been found before trying to access the next letter in the puzzle. Here is an updated version of the method that should resolve the errors:
```python
def is_word_hidden(self, word, i, j):
    # Check if the word is hidden in the puzzle
    # starting from the current position
    for k in range(len(word)):
        if self.puzzle[i + k][j + k] != word[k]:
            return False
    return True
```
With this updated method, the `search` method will correctly return `None` if the word is not found in the puzzle, and the tests should pass.
