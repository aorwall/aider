Explanation:
In this implementation, we define a custom set class called CustomSet.
It has a constructor that takes an optional list of elements, and initializes the set with those elements.
We also define several methods to implement the set operations:

* isempty: checks if the set is empty
* \_\_contains\_\_: checks if an element is in the set
* issubset: checks if the set is a subset of another set
* isdisjoint: checks if the set is disjoint with another set
* \_\_eq\_\_: checks if the set is equal to another set
* add: adds an element to the set
* intersection: returns the intersection of the set with another set
* \_\_sub\_\_: returns the difference of the set with another set
* \_\_add\_\_: returns the union of the set with another set

We also implement the \_\_init\_\_ method to initialize the set with the given elements.
We use a list to store the elements, and define several methods to perform set operations.

Note that we use the \_\_contains\_\_ method to check if an element is in the set, and the \_\_eq\_\_ method to check if the set is equal to another set.
We also use the \_\_sub\_\_ and \_\_add\_\_ methods to implement the difference and union operations, respectively.
