 The errors are caused by the fact that the `__eq__` method is trying to use the `len()` function on a generator expression, which is not allowed.

To fix the errors, you can modify the `__eq__` method to use the `all()` function instead of `len()` to check if all elements in the `other` set are also in the current set. Here's the updated code:
```python
class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=[]):
        self.elements = elements

    def isempty(self):
        return len(self.elements) == 0

    def __contains__(self, element):
        return element in self.elements

    def issubset(self, other):
        return all(element in other for element in self.elements)

    def isdisjoint(self, other):
        return not any(element in other for element in self.elements)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return all(element in other for element in self.elements)

    def add(self, element):
        if element not in self.elements:
            self.elements.append(element)

    def intersection(self, other):
        return CustomSet(element for element in self.elements if element in other)

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(element for element in self.elements if element not in other)

    def __add__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.elements + other.elements)
```
With this updated code, the tests should pass.
