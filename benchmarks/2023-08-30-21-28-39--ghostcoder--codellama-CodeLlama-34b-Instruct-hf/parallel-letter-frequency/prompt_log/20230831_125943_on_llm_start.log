<s>[INST]<<SYS>>
Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] Explanation:
In the calculate function, we first create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies. We then create a process pool with the number of CPU cores using the multiprocessing library. We map the texts to the calculate_letter_frequency function using the pool.map method, which applies the function to each text in parallel. We then reduce the results to a single dictionary by iterating over the results and updating the letter frequencies. Finally, we return the letter frequencies.

In the calculate_letter_frequency function, we create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies and iterate over the letters in the text. For each letter, we update the letter frequency in the dictionary. Finally, we return the letter frequencies.

I updated the existing file.</s>

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in parallel_letter_frequency.py to resolve the errors.
