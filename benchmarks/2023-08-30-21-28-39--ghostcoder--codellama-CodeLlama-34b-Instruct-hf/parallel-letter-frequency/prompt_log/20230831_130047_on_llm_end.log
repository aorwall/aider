 The errors in the testing output indicate that there are issues with the `calculate` function in the `parallel_letter_frequency.py` file. Specifically, the function is not properly handling the case where the input text contains non-letter characters, such as punctuation or numbers.

To fix the issue, you can modify the `calculate` function to ignore non-letter characters in the input text. Here's an updated version of the function that should resolve the testing errors:
```python
def calculate(text_input):
    # Create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies
    letter_frequencies = {}

    # Create a process pool with the number of CPU cores
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(multiprocessing.cpu_count())

    # Map the texts to the letter frequency calculation function
    results = pool.map(calculate_letter_frequency, text_input)

    # Reduce the results to a single dictionary
    for result in results:
        for letter, frequency in result.items():
            if letter not in letter_frequencies:
                letter_frequencies[letter] = 0
            letter_frequencies[letter] += frequency

    return letter_frequencies

def calculate_letter_frequency(text):
    # Create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies
    letter_frequencies = {}

    # Iterate over the letters in the text
    for letter in text:
        if letter.isalpha():
            if letter not in letter_frequencies:
                letter_frequencies[letter] = 0
            letter_frequencies[letter] += 1

    return letter_frequencies
```
In this updated version of the `calculate` function, we've added a check to ensure that only letters are counted in the letter frequency calculation. We've also updated the `calculate_letter_frequency` function to only count letters, and to ignore non-letter characters.

With these changes, the testing errors should be resolved, and the code should be able to correctly calculate the letter frequency of a given text.
