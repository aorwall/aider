Explanation:
In the calculate function, we first create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies. We then create a process pool with the number of CPU cores using the multiprocessing library. We map the texts to the calculate_letter_frequency function using the pool.map method, which applies the function to each text in parallel. We then reduce the results to a single dictionary by iterating over the results and updating the letter frequencies. Finally, we return the letter frequencies.

In the calculate_letter_frequency function, we create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies and iterate over the letters in the text. For each letter, we update the letter frequency in the dictionary. Finally, we return the letter frequencies.

I updated the existing file.
Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
import multiprocessing

def calculate(text_input):
    # Create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies
    letter_frequencies = {}

    # Create a process pool with the number of CPU cores
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(multiprocessing.cpu_count())

    # Map the texts to the letter frequency calculation function
    results = pool.map(calculate_letter_frequency, text_input)

    # Reduce the results to a single dictionary
    for result in results:
        for letter, frequency in result.items():
            if letter not in letter_frequencies:
                letter_frequencies[letter] = 0
            letter_frequencies[letter] += frequency

    return letter_frequencies

def calculate_letter_frequency(text):
    # Create a dictionary to store the letter frequencies
    letter_frequencies = {}

    # Iterate over the letters in the text
    for letter in text:
        if letter not in letter_frequencies:
            letter_frequencies[letter] = 0
        letter_frequencies[letter] += 1

    return letter_frequencies
```
Note that the calculate_letter_frequency function is not changed, as it is already implemented and working correctly. The changes are made only to the calculate function to make it parallel.
