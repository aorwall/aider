When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  \n\n\n```python\n# account is not open\nraise ValueError('account not open')\n\n# account is already open\nraise ValueError('account already open')\n\n# incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount\nraise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')\n\n# withdrawal is too big\nraise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')\n```\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
