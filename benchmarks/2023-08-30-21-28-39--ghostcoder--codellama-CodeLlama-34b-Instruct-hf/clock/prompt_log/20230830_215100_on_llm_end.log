 Here is the modified clock.py file with the implemented `__repr__` and `__str__` methods:
```python
class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour, minute):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Clock({self.hour}, {self.minute})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.hour}:{self.minute}"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.hour == other.hour and self.minute == other.minute

    def __add__(self, minutes):
        self.minute += minutes
        if self.minute >= 60:
            self.hour += 1
            self.minute -= 60
        return self

    def __sub__(self, minutes):
        self.minute -= minutes
        if self.minute < 0:
            self.hour -= 1
            self.minute += 60
        return self
```
Explanation:

I added the `__repr__` and `__str__` methods to the `Clock` class. The `__repr__` method returns a string representation of the `Clock` object that can be used to recreate the object, while the `__str__` method returns a more human-readable string representation of the `Clock` object.

In the `__repr__` method, I used an f-string to format the `hour` and `minute` attributes of the `Clock` object into a string. I also added the `Clock` class name to the beginning of the string to make it clear that it is a `Clock` object.

In the `__str__` method, I used an f-string to format the `hour` and `minute` attributes of the `Clock` object into a string in the format `HH:MM`.

I also added the `__eq__` method to the `Clock` class to allow for equality comparisons between `Clock` objects. This method checks if the `hour` and `minute` attributes of the two `Clock` objects are equal.

Finally, I added the `__add__` and `__sub__` methods to the `Clock` class to allow for addition and subtraction of minutes from the `Clock` object. These methods update the `minute` attribute of the `Clock` object and adjust the `hour` attribute if necessary.
