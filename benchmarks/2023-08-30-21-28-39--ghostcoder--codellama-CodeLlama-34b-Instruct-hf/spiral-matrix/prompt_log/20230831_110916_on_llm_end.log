Explanation:
In the spiral_matrix function, we first create a matrix of size x size, initialized with 0s. We then initialize the starting row and column, and the ending row and column, to 0. We also initialize a variable num to 1, which will be used to fill the matrix with natural numbers.

We then enter a while loop that will run until the starting row is greater than the ending row, or the starting column is greater than the ending column. Inside the while loop, we first fill the top row of the matrix with natural numbers, starting from num. We then increment the starting row, and fill the rightmost column of the matrix with natural numbers, starting from num. We then decrement the ending column, and fill the bottom row of the matrix with natural numbers, starting from num. We then decrement the ending row, and fill the leftmost column of the matrix with natural numbers, starting from num. We then increment the starting column, and repeat the process until the starting row is greater than the ending row, or the starting column is greater than the ending column.

Finally, we return the matrix.

Note that we use a nested for loop to fill each row and column of the matrix, and we use the range function to generate the appropriate indices for each row and column. We also use the modulo operator to determine when to switch from filling a row to filling a column, and vice versa.
