prompt:
 The issue is that the `factors` function is not returning the correct result for certain inputs. The function is supposed to return a list of prime factors of the input `value`, but it is not doing so for some inputs.

To fix the issue, you can modify the function to use a more efficient algorithm for finding prime factors. Here is an example of how you can modify the function to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime factors:
```python
def factors(value):
    result = []
    for i in range(2, int(value**0.5) + 1):
        if value % i == 0:
            result.append(i)
            value //= i
    if value > 1:
        result.append(value)
    return result
```
This algorithm is more efficient than the previous one because it only checks for factors up to the square root of the input `value`, which is sufficient to find all prime factors.

With this modification, the `factors` function should now pass all the tests.
