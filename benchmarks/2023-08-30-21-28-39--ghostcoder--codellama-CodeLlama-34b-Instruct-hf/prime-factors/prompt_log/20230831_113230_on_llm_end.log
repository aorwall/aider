```python
def factors(value):
    result = []
    for i in range(2, value + 1):
        while value % i == 0:
            result.append(i)
            value //= i
    return result
```
Explanation:
In the factors function, we initialize an empty list result and iterate through the numbers from 2 to the value. For each number, we check if it is a factor of the value by using the modulo operator (%). If it is a factor, we append it to the result list and divide the value by the factor using integer division (//=). We continue this process until the value is 1, at which point we return the result list.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient way to find prime factors, but it is a simple and straightforward approach that should be easy to understand and modify.
