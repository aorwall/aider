Explanation:

I added implementations for the following methods:

* `__add__`: Adds two rational numbers by multiplying the numerators and denominators, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__sub__`: Subtracts two rational numbers by multiplying the numerators and denominators, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__mul__`: Multiplies two rational numbers by multiplying the numerators and denominators, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__truediv__`: Divides two rational numbers by multiplying the numerators and denominators, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__abs__`: Returns the absolute value of a rational number by taking the absolute value of the numerator and denominator, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__pow__`: Raises a rational number to a power by raising the numerator and denominator to the power, then reducing the result to lowest terms.
* `__rpow__`: Raises a rational number to a power by raising the base to the power of the numerator and denominator, then reducing the result to lowest terms.

I also added a check for division by zero in the `__truediv__` method.

Note that the `__rpow__` method is not the same as the `__pow__` method, as it takes the base as an argument, rather than the exponent.
