Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Convert an octal number, represented as a string (e.g. '1735263'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in or external libraries to accomplish the conversion).

Implement octal to decimal conversion.
Given an octal input string, your program should produce a decimal output.

## Note

- Implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.
- Treat invalid input as octal 0.

## About Octal (Base-8)

Decimal is a base-10 system.

A number 233 in base 10 notation can be understood
as a linear combination of powers of 10:

- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1
- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10
- ...
- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.
- All these values are summed.

So:

```text
   233 # decimal
 = 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
 = 2*100  + 3*10   + 3*1
```

Octal is similar, but uses powers of 8 rather than powers of 10.

So:

```text
   233 # octal
 = 2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 3*8^0
 = 2*64  + 3*8   + 3*1
 = 128   + 24    + 3
 = 155
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: octal.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in octal.py to resolve the errors.
