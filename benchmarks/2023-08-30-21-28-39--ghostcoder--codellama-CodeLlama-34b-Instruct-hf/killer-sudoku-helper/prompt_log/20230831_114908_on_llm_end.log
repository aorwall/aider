 The issue is that the `combinations` function is not implemented. It is defined, but it does not have any code inside it.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `combinations` function. Here is an example implementation:
```
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        if i not in exclude:
            result.append([i])
    return result
```
This implementation uses a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `target`, and for each number, it checks if it is not in the `exclude` list. If it is not, it appends the number to a list and returns the list.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
