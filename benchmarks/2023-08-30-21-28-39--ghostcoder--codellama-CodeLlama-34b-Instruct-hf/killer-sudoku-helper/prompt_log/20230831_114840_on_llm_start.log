Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.

```python

```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.

# Instructions

A friend of yours is learning how to solve Killer Sudokus (rules below) but struggling to figure out which digits can go in a cage.
They ask you to help them out by writing a small program that lists all valid combinations for a given cage, and any constraints that affect the cage.

To make the output of your program easy to read, the combinations it returns must be sorted.

## Killer Sudoku Rules

- [Standard Sudoku rules][sudoku-rules] apply.
- The digits in a cage, usually marked by a dotted line, add up to the small number given in the corner of the cage.
- A digit may only occur once in a cage.

For a more detailed explanation, check out [this guide][killer-guide].

## Example 1: Cage with only 1 possible combination

In a 3-digit cage with a sum of 7, there is only one valid combination: 124.

- 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- Any other combination that adds up to 7, e.g. 232, would violate the rule of not repeating digits within a cage.

![Sudoku grid, with three killer cages that are marked as grouped together. The first killer cage is in the 3×3 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3×3 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3×3 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]

## Example 2: Cage with several combinations

In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:

- 19
- 28
- 37
- 46

![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]

## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted

In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:

- 28
- 37

19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.

![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]
