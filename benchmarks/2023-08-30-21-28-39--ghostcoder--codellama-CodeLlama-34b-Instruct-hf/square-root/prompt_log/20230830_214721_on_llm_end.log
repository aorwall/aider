 The issue is that the `square_root` function is not implemented. It is currently defined as `pass`, which means it does nothing and returns `None`.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `square_root` function. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def square_root(number):
    return number ** 0.5
```
This implementation uses the built-in `**` operator to calculate the square root of the input number.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
