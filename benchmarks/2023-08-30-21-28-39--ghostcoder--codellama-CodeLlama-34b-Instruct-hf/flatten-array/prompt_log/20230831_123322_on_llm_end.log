```python
def flatten(iterable):
    result = []
    for item in iterable:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            result.extend(flatten(item))
        elif item is not None:
            result.append(item)
    return result
```
Explanation:
In the flatten function, we first initialize an empty list called result. We then iterate over the input iterable using a for-loop. For each item in the iterable, we check if it is a list using the isinstance() function. If it is a list, we recursively call the flatten function on it and extend the result list with the returned flattened list. If the item is not a list, we check if it is not None, and if it is not, we append it to the result list. Finally, we return the result list.

Note: The isinstance() function is used to check if an object is an instance of a class. In this case, we are checking if the item is an instance of the list class.
