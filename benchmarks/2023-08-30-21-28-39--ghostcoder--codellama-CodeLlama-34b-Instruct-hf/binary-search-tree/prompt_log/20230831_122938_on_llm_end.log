The error message indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in the test file. Specifically, it says that the module `binary_search_tree` does not have a `TreeNode` attribute.

Looking at the code in `binary_search_tree.py`, we can see that the class `Node` is defined, but there is no class `TreeNode`. It seems that the test file is expecting a class `TreeNode` to be defined in `binary_search_tree.py`.

To fix this issue, you can add the following code to `binary_search_tree.py`:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```
This will define the `TreeNode` class, which the test file is expecting.

Alternatively, you can modify the test file to expect the `Node` class instead of the `TreeNode` class. This can be done by changing the import statement in the test file to:
```python
from binary_search_tree import Node
```
This will import the `Node` class from the `binary_search_tree` module, which is the class that is actually defined in `binary_search_tree.py`.
