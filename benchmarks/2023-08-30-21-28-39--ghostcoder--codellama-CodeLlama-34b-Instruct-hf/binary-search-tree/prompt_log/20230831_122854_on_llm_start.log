Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.

When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.

Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.
Now we must sort the entire array again!
We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.
But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.

Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.

A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.
Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.
The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.
Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.
All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.

For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:

      4
     /
    2

If we then added 6, it would look like this:

      4
     / \
    2   6

If we then added 3, it would look like this

       4
     /   \
    2     6
     \
      3

And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this

          4
        /   \
       /     \
      2       6
     / \     / \
    1   3   5   7

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search_tree.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] To implement a binary search tree in Python, we can define a `Node` class to represent each node in the tree, and a `BinarySearchTree` class to represent the tree itself.

Here's an example implementation of the `Node` class:

```None
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
The `Node` class takes three arguments in its constructor: `data`, `left`, and `right`. The `data` argument is the value stored in the node, and the `left` and `right` arguments are references to the left and right child nodes, respectively.

Here's an example implementation of the `BinarySearchTree` class:</s>

```python
class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self, tree_data):
        self.root = None
        self.size = 0
        self.insert(tree_data)

    def insert(self, data):
        if self.root is None:
