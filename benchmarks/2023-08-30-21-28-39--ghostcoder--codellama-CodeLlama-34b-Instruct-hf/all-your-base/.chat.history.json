When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` for different input and output bases. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a meaningful message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# for input.\nraise ValueError(\"input base must be >= 2\")\n\n# another example for input.\nraise ValueError(\"all digits must satisfy 0 <= d < input base\")\n\n# or, for output.\nraise ValueError(\"output base must be >= 2\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: all_your_base.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

Specifically, the line `input_value = input_value * input_base + digit` is not correct when the input base is not a power of 10, because it assumes that the input digits are in base 10.\n\nTo fix this, you can use the `pow` function to calculate the value of the input digit in the input base, like this: `input_value = input_value * pow(input_base, digit)`. This will correctly handle the case where the input base is not a power of 10.\n\nHere is the corrected code:",
