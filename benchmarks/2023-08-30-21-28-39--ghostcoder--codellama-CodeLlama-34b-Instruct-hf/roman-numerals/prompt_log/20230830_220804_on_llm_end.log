 The issue is that the `roman` function is not implemented. It is defined, but it does not have any code inside it.

To fix the issue, you need to implement the `roman` function. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def roman(number):
    roman_numerals = {
        1000: "M",
        900: "CM",
        500: "D",
        400: "CD",
        100: "C",
        90: "XC",
        50: "L",
        40: "XL",
        10: "X",
        9: "IX",
        5: "V",
        4: "IV",
        1: "I"
    }
    result = ""
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():
        while number >= value:
            result += numeral
            number -= value
    return result
```
This implementation uses a dictionary to map the integer values to their corresponding Roman numerals. It then iterates over the dictionary, adding the corresponding numeral to the result string for each value that is greater than or equal to the input number. Finally, it returns the result string.

With this implementation, the tests should pass.
