Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans were a clever bunch.
They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.
They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.
One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.
This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.
For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
(notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

```text
 1  => I
10  => X
 7  => VII
```

The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in roman_numerals.py to resolve the errors.
