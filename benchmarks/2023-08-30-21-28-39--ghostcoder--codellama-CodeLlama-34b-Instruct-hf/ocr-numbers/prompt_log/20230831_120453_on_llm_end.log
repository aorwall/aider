 I have updated the `ocr_numbers.py` file according to the instructions provided. Here is the updated file:
```python
def convert(input_grid):
    """
    Converts a 3x4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces into a string of binary digits.
    """
    if len(input_grid) % 4 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")
    if len(input_grid[0]) % 3 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")

    binary_string = ""
    for row in input_grid:
        for column in row:
            if column == "|":
                binary_string += "1"
            elif column == "_":
                binary_string += "0"
            else:
                binary_string += "?"
    return binary_string
```
I have also added a docstring to the `convert` function to provide a brief description of what the function does.

The updated file includes the following changes:

* The function now checks if the number of input lines is a multiple of 4 and raises a `ValueError` if it is not.
* The function now checks if the number of input columns is a multiple of 3 and raises a `ValueError` if it is not.
* The function now converts the input grid into a string of binary digits, with "1" representing pipes and "0" representing underscores.
* The function now returns the binary string.
