 The issue is that the `convert` function is not correctly handling the input grid. The function is expecting a 3x4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, but the input grid is not in the correct format.

The input grid is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid. The function is iterating over each row and then iterating over each character in the row. However, the function is not correctly handling the characters in the row.

To fix the issue, you need to modify the `convert` function to correctly handle the input grid. Here is an updated version of the function that should work:
```python
def convert(input_grid):
    """
    Converts a 3x4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces into a string of binary digits.
    """
    if len(input_grid) % 4 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")
    if len(input_grid[0]) % 3 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")

    binary_string = ""
    for row in input_grid:
        for column in row:
            if column == "|":
                binary_string += "1"
            elif column == "_":
                binary_string += "0"
            else:
                binary_string += "?"
    return binary_string
```
This function first checks that the input grid is a 3x4 grid by checking that the number of rows and columns is a multiple of 4 and 3, respectively. If the input grid is not in the correct format, the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

The function then iterates over each row in the input grid and then iterates over each character in the row. If the character is a pipe, it adds a "1" to the binary string. If the character is an underscore, it adds a "0" to the binary string. If the character is neither a pipe nor an underscore, it adds a "?" to the binary string.

Finally, the function returns the binary string.

With this updated `convert` function, the tests should now pass.
