```python
def trinary(string):
    result = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        result += int(char) * 3 ** (len(string) - i - 1)
    return result
```
Explanation:
In the trinary function, we first initialize a variable result with the value 0. We then iterate over each character in the input string using enumerate, and for each character, we calculate its trinary value by multiplying its integer value by 3 raised to the power of the length of the input string minus the current index minus 1. We then add this value to the result. Finally, we return the result.

Note that we use the built-in function int to convert each character to an integer, and we use the built-in function len to get the length of the input string. We also use the built-in function enumerate to iterate over the characters in the input string and their indices.
