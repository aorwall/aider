 The issue is that the `trinary` function is not handling invalid trinary strings correctly. The function is assuming that the input string is a valid trinary string, but the test case `13201` is not a valid trinary string because it contains the digit `3`, which is not a valid trinary digit.

To fix the issue, you can modify the `trinary` function to check if the input string is a valid trinary string before attempting to convert it. Here's an updated version of the function that includes this check:
```python
def trinary(string):
    if not is_valid_trinary(string):
        return 0
    result = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        result += int(char) * 3 ** (len(string) - i - 1)
    return result

def is_valid_trinary(string):
    return all(char in '012' for char in string)
```
With this updated function, the test case `13201` will now return 0, as expected.
