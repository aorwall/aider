The code you provided is a function called `prime` that takes an integer `number` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is prime or not.


The tests you provided are failing because the function is not correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def prime(number):
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
The changes made are:

* The function name was changed to `prime` to match the test.
* The `if` statement was indented to match the python syntax.
* The `for` loop was fixed to iterate from 2 to the square root of the number.
* The `if` statement inside the loop was fixed to check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.
* The `return` statement was fixed to return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

Please note that this code is not optimized and can be further improved for performance.
