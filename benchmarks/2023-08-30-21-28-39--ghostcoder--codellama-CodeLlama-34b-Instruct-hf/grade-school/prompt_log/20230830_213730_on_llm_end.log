 The errors in the testing output indicate that the `added()` method in the `School` class is not returning the correct value. The `added()` method is supposed to return a list of booleans indicating whether each student was added to the school or not.

To fix the issue, you can modify the `added()` method to return the correct value. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade not in self.students:
            self.students[grade] = []
        self.students[grade].append(name)

    def roster(self):
        return self.students

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        return self.students[grade_number]

    def added(self):
        return [True if name in self.students[grade] else False for grade in self.students for name in self.students[grade]]
```
In this modified version of the `School` class, the `added()` method returns a list of booleans indicating whether each student was added to the school or not. The method uses a list comprehension to iterate over the students in each grade and check if they were added to the school.

With this modification, the testing errors should be resolved, and the tests should pass.
