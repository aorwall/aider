When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the slice length is zero.\nraise ValueError(\"slice length cannot be zero\")\n\n# if the slice length is negative.\nraise ValueError(\"slice length cannot be negative\")\n\n# if the series provided is empty.\nraise ValueError(\"series cannot be empty\")\n\n# if the slice length is longer than the series.\nraise ValueError(\"slice length cannot be greater than series length\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
