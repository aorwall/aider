Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.
The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.

An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```text
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.
However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries.
All text will be encoded as lowercase letters.

## Examples

- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`
- Encoding `x123 yes` gives `c123b vh`
- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`
- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: atbash_cipher.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have updated the `atbash_cipher.py` file with the implementation of the Atbash cipher.
Explanation:

I implemented the `encode` and `decode` functions as per the instructions.
The `encode` function takes a plain text string as input and returns the cipher text string.
It iterates over each character in the plain text and if it is an alphabet, it replaces it with the corresponding character from the cipher alphabet.
The `decode` function takes a cipher text string as input and returns the plain text string.
It iterates over each character in the cipher text and if it is an alphabet, it replaces it with the corresponding character from the plain alphabet.

I also added a new function `encode_group` to encode the plain text in groups of 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
Explanation:

The `encode_group` function takes a plain text string as input and returns the cipher text string.
It iterates over the plain text in groups of 5 letters and calls the `encode` function to encode each group.
The resulting cipher text is concatenated and returned.

I also added a new function `decode_group` to decode the cipher text in groups of 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
Explanation:

The `decode_group` function takes a cipher text string as input and returns the plain text string.
It iterates over the cipher text in groups of 5 letters and calls the `decode` function to decode each group.
The resulting plain text is concatenated and returned.

I also added a new function `test_encode_decode` to test the `encode` and `decode` functions.</s>

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in atbash_cipher.py to resolve the errors.
