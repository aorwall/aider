 The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `decode` function in the `atbash_cipher` module. The `decode` function is not defined in the `atbash_cipher.py` file, which is causing the import error.

To fix the issue, you need to define the `decode` function in the `atbash_cipher.py` file. Here's an example of how you can define the `decode` function:
```python
def decode(cipher_text):
    plain_text = ""
    for char in cipher_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            plain_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        else:
            plain_text += char
    return plain_text
```
This function takes a cipher text string as input, and returns the decoded plain text string. It iterates over each character in the cipher text, and if it is an alphabet, it replaces it with the corresponding character from the plain alphabet. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of the character, and the `chr` function is used to get the character from the ASCII value.

Once you define the `decode` function in the `atbash_cipher.py` file, the import error should be resolved, and the tests should pass.
