 The errors are caused by the `get_winner` method not returning the correct value in certain cases. Specifically, the method is not returning `None` when the game is not over and no winner has been found, and it is not returning the correct player when a winner has been found.

To fix the errors, you can modify the `get_winner` method as follows:
```python
def get_winner(self):
    # Check if there is a winner
    if self.winner:
        return self.winner

    # Check if the game is over
    if self.is_game_over():
        return None

    # Check if player O has won
    if self.has_won(self.player_o):
        self.winner = self.player_o
        return self.winner

    # Check if player X has won
    if self.has_won(self.player_x):
        self.winner = self.player_x
        return self.winner

    # If the game is not over and no winner has been found, return None
    return None
```
This modified version of the `get_winner` method will return `None` when the game is not over and no winner has been found, and it will return the correct player when a winner has been found. This should resolve the testing errors.
