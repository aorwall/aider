prompt:
 The error message indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in the test file `binary_search_test.py`. Specifically, it says that it cannot import the name `find` from the module `binary_search` (which is the file `binary_search.py` in the same directory).

It's likely that the issue is caused by a typo or a missing function in the `binary_search.py` file. The function `find` is not defined in the code you provided, so it's not possible to import it.

To fix the issue, you should either define the `find` function in the `binary_search.py` file, or remove the import statement from the test file.
