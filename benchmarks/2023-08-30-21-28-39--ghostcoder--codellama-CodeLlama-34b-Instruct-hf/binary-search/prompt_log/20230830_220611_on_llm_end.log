 Here is the updated code for the binary search algorithm:
```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
Explanation:

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the list in half and searching for the target value in the appropriate half.

The algorithm starts by setting the `low` and `high` variables to the beginning and end of the list, respectively. It then calculates the middle index of the list using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.

The algorithm then checks if the value at the middle index is equal to the target value. If it is, the algorithm returns the middle index. If the value at the middle index is less than the target value, the algorithm sets the `low` variable to the middle index plus 1 and repeats the process. If the value at the middle index is greater than the target value, the algorithm sets the `high` variable to the middle index minus 1 and repeats the process.

The algorithm continues to divide the list in half and search for the target value until the `low` variable is greater than the `high` variable. If the `low` variable is greater than the `high` variable, the algorithm returns -1, indicating that the target value was not found in the list.

I added a new file.
