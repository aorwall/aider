 I have modified the `gigasecond.py` file to include a function called `add_gigasecond` that takes a `datetime` object as an argument and returns a new `datetime` object that represents the date and time one gigasecond after the input date and time.

Here is the updated `gigasecond.py` file:
```
import datetime

def add_gigasecond(dt):
    """
    Add one gigasecond (10^9 seconds) to a datetime object.

    Args:
        dt (datetime.datetime): The input datetime object.

    Returns:
        datetime.datetime: The datetime object one gigasecond after the input datetime.
    """
    return dt + datetime.timedelta(seconds=10**9)
```
I have also added a docstring to the `add_gigasecond` function to provide a brief description of what the function does and the parameters it takes.

I have not modified any unit tests, as they are not part of the exercise.
