 Here is the updated code for the `Queen` class in the `queen_attack.py` file:
```python
class Queen:
    def __init__(self, row, column):
        if row < 0 or column < 0:
            raise ValueError("row and column must be positive")
        if row > 7 or column > 7:
            raise ValueError("row and column must be on the board")
        self.row = row
        self.column = column

    def can_attack(self, another_queen):
        if self.row == another_queen.row and self.column == another_queen.column:
            raise ValueError("Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square")
        return self.row == another_queen.row or self.column == another_queen.column
```
In this updated code, I have added error handling for the following scenarios:

* If the `row` or `column` parameter passed to the `Queen` constructor is negative, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "row and column must be positive".
* If the `row` or `column` parameter passed to the `Queen` constructor is not on the defined board (i.e., not between 0 and 7), a `ValueError` is raised with the message "row and column must be on the board".
* If both the queens passed to the `can_attack()` method are on the same location, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square".

I have also added a check in the `can_attack()` method to ensure that the two queens are not on the same location, and if they are, a `ValueError` is raised with the appropriate message.

I hope this updated code meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
