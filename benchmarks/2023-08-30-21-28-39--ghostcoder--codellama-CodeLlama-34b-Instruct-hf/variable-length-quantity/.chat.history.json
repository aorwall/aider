When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the sequence is incomplete\nraise ValueError(\"incomplete sequence\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

For each number, we first append the least significant 7 bits to the result list. Then, we shift the number right by 7 bits and repeat the process until the number is 0. We use the bitwise AND operator (&) to extract the least significant 7 bits and the bitwise OR operator (|) to set the most significant bit to 1 for all but the last byte.\n\nIn the decode function, we iterate over the input bytes and decode each one as a variable length quantity. We use a result variable to store the decoded number. For each byte, we shift the result left by 7 bits and then bitwise OR it with the least significant 7 bits of the byte. If the most significant bit of the byte is 0, we break out of the loop and return the decoded number.\n\nI updated the existing file.",
