Explanation:

I updated the `Robot` class to include the `simulate` method, which takes a list of instructions as an argument.
The `simulate` method iterates over the instructions and performs the corresponding actions on the robot.
I also added a `test_robot_movement` function to test the robot's movement.
The test function creates a robot at {7, 3} facing north and simulates the "RAALAL" instruction sequence.
It then asserts that the robot's final position and direction are as expected.

Note that I did not modify the existing function or class stubs, as requested.
I only implemented the `simulate` method and the test function.
