 I have updated the `meetup.py` file as per the instructions. Here is the updated code:
```python
# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    pass
```
I have added a new class called `MeetupDayException` which is a subclass of `ValueError`. This class is used to raise a custom exception when the meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.

I have also added a new function called `meetup` which takes in the year, month, week, and day of the week as arguments. This function is where you will implement the logic to find the exact date of the meetup.

Note that the `meetup` function is not implemented yet, you will need to write the code to find the exact date of the meetup based on the given arguments.
