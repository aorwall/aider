Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i

# Introduction

You work for a company that makes an online multiplayer game called Lexiconia.

To play the game, each player is given 13 letters, which they must rearrange to create words.
Different letters have different point values, since it's easier to create words with some letters than others.

The game was originally launched in English, but it is very popular, and now the company wants to expand to other languages as well.

Different languages need to support different point values for letters.
The point values are determined by how often letters are used, compared to other letters in that language.

For example, the letter 'C' is quite common in English, and is only worth 3 points.
But in Norwegian it's a very rare letter, and is worth 10 points.

To make it easier to add new languages, your team needs to change the way letters and their point values are stored in the game.
# Instructions

Your task is to change the data format of letters and their point values in the game.

Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping.

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

This needs to be changed to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- etc.

As part of this change, the team has also decided to change the letters to be lower-case rather than upper-case.

~~~~exercism/note
If you want to look at how the data was previously structured and how it needs to change, take a look at the examples in the test suite.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: etl.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] To modify the data format of letters and their point values in the game, we need to change the way letters are stored in the game. Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping. We need to change this to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

Here's an example of how the data could be structured:

```python
letters = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 3,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 2,
    "e": 1,
    "f": 4,
    "g": 2,
    "h": 4,
    "i": 1,
    "j": 8,
    "k": 5,
    "l": 1,
    "m": 3,
    "n": 1,
    "o": 1,
    "p": 3,
    "q": 10,
    "r": 1,
    "s": 1,
    "t": 1,
    "u": 2,
    "v": 4,
    "w": 4,
    "x": 8,
    "y": 4,
    "z": 10
}
```
In this example, each letter is stored with its corresponding point value. The letters are also stored in lower-case, as per the instructions.

To implement this change, we need to modify the `etl.py` file to use this new data structure. Here's an example of how the file could be modified:</s>
<s>[INST]Filepath: etl.py
```python
import json
def transform(legacy_data):
    letters = json.loads(legacy_data)
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in letters.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return json.dumps(new_data)

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in etl.py to resolve the errors.
