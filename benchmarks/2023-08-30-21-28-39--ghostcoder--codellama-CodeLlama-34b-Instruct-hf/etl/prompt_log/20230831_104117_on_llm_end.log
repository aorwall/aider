 To modify the data format of letters and their point values in the game, we need to change the way letters are stored in the game. Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping. We need to change this to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

Here's an example of how the data could be structured:
```python
letters = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 3,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 2,
    "e": 1,
    "f": 4,
    "g": 2,
    "h": 4,
    "i": 1,
    "j": 8,
    "k": 5,
    "l": 1,
    "m": 3,
    "n": 1,
    "o": 1,
    "p": 3,
    "q": 10,
    "r": 1,
    "s": 1,
    "t": 1,
    "u": 2,
    "v": 4,
    "w": 4,
    "x": 8,
    "y": 4,
    "z": 10
}
```
In this example, each letter is stored with its corresponding point value. The letters are also stored in lower-case, as per the instructions.

To implement this change, we need to modify the `etl.py` file to use this new data structure. Here's an example of how the file could be modified:
```python
import json

def transform(legacy_data):
    letters = json.loads(legacy_data)
    new_data = {}
    for letter, score in letters.items():
        new_data[letter.lower()] = score
    return json.dumps(new_data)
```
In this example, we first load the legacy data into a dictionary using the `json.loads()` function. We then create a new dictionary called `new_data` to store the transformed data.

We then iterate over the items in the `letters` dictionary, and for each item, we lowercase the letter and add it to the `new_data` dictionary with its corresponding point value.

Finally, we return the transformed data as a JSON string using the `json.dumps()` function.

With this change, the data will be stored in the new format, with each letter and its point value stored in a one-to-one mapping.
