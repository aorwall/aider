Explanation:
In the `translate` function, we first split the given text into individual words using the `split` method.
We then iterate over each word and translate it to Pig Latin using the rules provided in the instructions.
If the word starts with a vowel sound, we simply add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
If the word starts with a consonant sound, we move the consonant sound to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
We then add the translated word to a list of translated words and join them into a single string using the `join` method.
Finally, we return the translated text.

Note that we have not changed the existing function or class stubs, as requested in the instructions.
We have only implemented the `translate` function and modified the existing `pig_latin.py` file to include the new function.
