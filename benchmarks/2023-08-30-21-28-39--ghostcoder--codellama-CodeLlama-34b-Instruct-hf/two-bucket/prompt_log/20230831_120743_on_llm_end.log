 Here is the updated code for the two_bucket.py file:
```python
def measure(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket):
    # Initialize variables
    actions = 0
    current_bucket = start_bucket
    other_bucket = 1 if start_bucket == 2 else 2
    current_bucket_size = bucket_one if start_bucket == 1 else bucket_two
    other_bucket_size = bucket_two if start_bucket == 1 else bucket_one

    # Perform actions until the goal is reached or it's impossible to reach
    while current_bucket_size != goal and current_bucket_size + other_bucket_size >= goal:
        # If the current bucket is full, pour it into the other bucket
        if current_bucket_size == current_bucket:
            pour_amount = min(current_bucket_size, other_bucket_size - current_bucket_size)
            current_bucket_size -= pour_amount
            other_bucket_size += pour_amount
            actions += 1
        # If the other bucket is full, pour it into the current bucket
        elif other_bucket_size == other_bucket:
            pour_amount = min(other_bucket_size, current_bucket_size - other_bucket_size)
            other_bucket_size -= pour_amount
            current_bucket_size += pour_amount
            actions += 1
        # If the current bucket is empty, fill it
        elif current_bucket_size == 0:
            current_bucket_size = current_bucket
            actions += 1
        # If the other bucket is empty, fill it
        elif other_bucket_size == 0:
            other_bucket_size = other_bucket
            actions += 1

    # Return the number of actions and the final bucket with the goal amount
    return actions, current_bucket if current_bucket_size == goal else other_bucket
```
I added a new function called `measure` that takes in four parameters: `bucket_one`, `bucket_two`, `goal`, and `start_bucket`. The function initializes several variables, including `actions`, `current_bucket`, `other_bucket`, `current_bucket_size`, and `other_bucket_size`.

The function then enters a while loop that continues until the `goal` is reached or it's impossible to reach. Inside the loop, the function checks the size of the `current_bucket` and the `other_bucket`. If the `current_bucket` is full, it pours the contents into the `other_bucket`. If the `other_bucket` is full, it pours the contents into the `current_bucket`. If the `current_bucket` is empty, it fills it. If the `other_bucket` is empty, it fills it.

After the loop, the function returns the number of actions and the final bucket with the `goal` amount.

I also updated the existing `two_bucket` function to call the new `measure` function and return the results.

Here is the updated code for the two_bucket.py file:
```python
def two_bucket(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket):
    actions, final_bucket = measure(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket)
    return actions, final_bucket
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
