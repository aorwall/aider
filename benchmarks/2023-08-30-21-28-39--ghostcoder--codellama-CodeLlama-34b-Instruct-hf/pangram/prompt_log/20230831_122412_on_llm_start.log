Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Introduction

You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.
They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.
To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.

They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.
You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.

~~~~exercism/note
Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".

The best known English pangram is:

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

# Instructions

Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.

A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).

For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
