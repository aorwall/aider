When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThe Collatz Conjecture is only concerned with **strictly positive integers**, so this exercise expects you to use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) and \"throw\" a `ValueError` in your solution if the given value is zero or a negative integer. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# example when argument is zero or a negative integer\nraise ValueError(\"Only positive integers are allowed\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: collatz_conjecture.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
