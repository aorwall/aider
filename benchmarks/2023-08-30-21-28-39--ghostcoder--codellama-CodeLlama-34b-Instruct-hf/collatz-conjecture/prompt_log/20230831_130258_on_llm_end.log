def steps(number):
    if number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = 3 * number + 1
        count += 1
    return count
```


Explanation:
In the steps function, we first check if the given number is less than or equal to 0. If it is, we raise a ValueError with the message "Only positive integers are allowed".

We then initialize a variable count to 0, which will keep track of the number of steps.

We use a while loop to repeatedly apply the Collatz Conjecture to the number until it reaches 1. If the number is even, we divide it by 2. If it's odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1. We increment count by 1 in each iteration.

Once the loop exits, we return the value of count, which represents the number of steps required to reach 1.
