 The errors in the testing output indicate that there are issues with the `decode` function in the `run_length_encoding.py` file. Specifically, the function is not able to handle inputs that contain whitespace or non-numeric characters.

To fix these issues, you can modify the `decode` function to handle these cases as follows:
```python
def decode(string):
    decoded_string = ""
    i = 0
    while i < len(string):
        if string[i].isdigit():
            count = int(string[i])
            decoded_string += count * string[i+1]
            i += 2
        else:
            decoded_string += string[i]
            i += 1
    return decoded_string
```
This modified version of the `decode` function first checks if the current character is a digit. If it is, it extracts the count and the character to be repeated, and then repeats the character the specified number of times. If the current character is not a digit, it simply appends it to the decoded string and moves on to the next character.

With these changes, the `decode` function should be able to handle inputs with whitespace and non-numeric characters correctly.
