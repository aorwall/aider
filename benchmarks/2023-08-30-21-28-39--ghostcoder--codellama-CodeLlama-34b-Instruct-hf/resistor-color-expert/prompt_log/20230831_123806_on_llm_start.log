Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path

Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.

# Introduction

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
Like the previous `Resistor Color Duo` and `Resistor Color Trio` exercises, you will be translating resistor color bands to human-readable labels.

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
- Each band acts as a digit of a number.
  For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.
# Instructions

In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.
The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.
The color bands are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.
For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.
In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.
Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.
For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.

The tolerance band will have one of these values:

- Grey - 0.05%
- Violet - 0.1%
- Blue - 0.25%
- Green - 0.5%
- Brown - 1%
- Red - 2%
- Gold - 5%
- Silver - 10%

The four-band resistor is built up like this:

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.

The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Value_3 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-orange-black-green would be 333 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-red-orange-blue-violet would be 323M ohms with a ±0.10 tolerance.

There are also one band resistors.
One band resistors only have the color black with a value of 0.

This exercise is about translating the resistor band colors into a label:

"... ohms ...%"

So an input of "orange", "orange", "black, green" should return:

"33 ohms ±0.5%"

When there are more than a thousand ohms, we say "kiloohms".
 That's similar to saying "kilometer" for 1000 meters, and "kilograms" for 1000 grams.

So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", grey should return:

"33 kiloohms ±0.05%"

When there are more than a million ohms, we say "megaohms".

So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", "red" should return:

"33 megaohms ±2%"

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_expert.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have modified the `resistor_color_expert.py` file to include the necessary code to translate resistor color bands to a label.

Here is the updated file:</s>
