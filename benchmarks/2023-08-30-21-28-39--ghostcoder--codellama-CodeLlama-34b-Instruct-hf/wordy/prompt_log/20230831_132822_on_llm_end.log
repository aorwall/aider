 I have updated the `wordy.py` file to include the `factorial` function and the `answer` function. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given integer, and the `answer` function parses and evaluates simple math word problems.

Here is the updated `wordy.py` file:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def answer(question):
    # Parse the question and extract the numbers and operations
    numbers = []
    operations = []
    for word in question.split():
        if word.isdigit():
            numbers.append(int(word))
        elif word in ["plus", "minus", "multiplied", "divided"]:
            operations.append(word)
    # Evaluate the expression
    result = numbers[0]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if operations[i - 1] == "plus":
            result += numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == "minus":
            result -= numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == "multiplied":
            result *= numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == "divided":
            result /= numbers[i]
    return result
```
I also added some unit tests to the `test_wordy.py` file to test the `factorial` and `answer` functions:
```python
import unittest

class TestWordy(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_factorial(self):
        self.assertEqual(factorial(5), 120)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(13), 6227020800)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(25), 15511210043330985984000000)

    def test_answer(self):
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 5 plus 13?"), 18)
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 7 minus 5?"), 2)
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 6 multiplied by 4?"), 24)
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 25 divided by 5?"), 5)
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?"), 24)
        self.assertEqual(answer("What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?"), 15)
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, answer, "What is 1 plus plus 2?")
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, answer, "What is 1 plus 2 multiplied by?")
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, answer, "What is 1 plus 2 divided by 0?")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
The unit tests cover a variety of inputs and edge cases to ensure that the `factorial` and `answer` functions are working correctly.
