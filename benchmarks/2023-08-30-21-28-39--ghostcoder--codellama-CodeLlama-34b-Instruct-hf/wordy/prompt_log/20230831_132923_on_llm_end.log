 The errors in the testing output indicate that the `answer` function is not properly parsing the input question and extracting the numbers and operations. The `numbers` and `operations` lists are not being populated correctly, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the elements of these lists.

To fix the issue, you can modify the `answer` function to use regular expressions to extract the numbers and operations from the input question. Here's an updated version of the `answer` function that uses regular expressions:
```python
import re

def answer(question):
    # Use regular expressions to extract the numbers and operations
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', question)
    operations = re.findall(r'[+-*/]', question)

    # Evaluate the expression
    result = numbers[0]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if operations[i - 1] == '+':
            result += numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == '-':
            result -= numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == '*':
            result *= numbers[i]
        elif operations[i - 1] == '/':
            result /= numbers[i]

    return result
```
This version of the `answer` function uses the `re.findall` function to extract the numbers and operations from the input question. The `re.findall` function takes two arguments: a regular expression pattern and a string to search. In this case, the regular expression pattern `\d+` matches one or more digits, and the pattern `[+-*/]` matches any of the four arithmetic operations.

The `re.findall` function returns a list of all the matches in the input string. The `numbers` and `operations` lists are populated with the extracted numbers and operations, respectively.

With these changes, the `answer` function should now be able to correctly parse the input question and evaluate the expression.
