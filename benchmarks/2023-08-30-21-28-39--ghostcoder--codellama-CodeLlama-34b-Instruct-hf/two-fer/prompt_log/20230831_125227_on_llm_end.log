```python
def two_fer(name):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```
Explanation:
In the two_fer function, we check if the name argument is truthy (i.e., not an empty string). If it is, we return a string with the name and "one for me". If it's not, we return a string with "one for you" and "one for me".

Note that we don't need to handle the case where the name is an empty string, as the function will return "one for you" in that case.
