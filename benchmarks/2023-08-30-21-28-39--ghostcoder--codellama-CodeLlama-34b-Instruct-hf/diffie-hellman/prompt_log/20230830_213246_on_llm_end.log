```python
def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)


def public_key(p, g, private):
    return pow(g, private, p)


def secret(p, public, private):
    return pow(public, private, p)
```
Explanation:
I updated the existing functions to use the `random` module to generate private keys and calculate public and secret keys.
I kept the existing function and class stubs, as they will be called from unit tests.
I did not implement or change any unit tests.
I only used standard Python libraries, and did not suggest installing any packages.

Note: This implementation is only for educational purposes and is not secure for cryptographic use.
