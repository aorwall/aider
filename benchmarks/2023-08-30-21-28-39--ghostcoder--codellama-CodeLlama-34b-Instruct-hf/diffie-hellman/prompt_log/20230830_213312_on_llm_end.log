 The issue is that the `random` module is not imported in the `diffie_hellman.py` file. To fix the issue, you need to add the following line at the top of the file:
```python
import random
```
This will import the `random` module and allow you to use its functions, such as `random.randint()`, in the `private_key()` function.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import random

def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)


def public_key(p, g, private):
    return pow(g, private, p)


def secret(p, public, private):
    return pow(public, private, p)
```
With this change, the tests should now pass.
