Explanation:

I added three methods to the `HighScores` class:

* `get_high_score()`: This method returns the highest score from the list of scores.
* `get_last_score()`: This method returns the last added score.
* `get_top_scores(n)`: This method returns a list of the top `n` scores, sorted in descending order.

I used the built-in `max()` function to get the highest score, and the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the scores in descending order.

I also added a new file, `high_scores.py`, which contains the `HighScores` class and its methods.

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def get_high_score(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def get_last_score(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def get_top_scores(self, n):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:n]
```
