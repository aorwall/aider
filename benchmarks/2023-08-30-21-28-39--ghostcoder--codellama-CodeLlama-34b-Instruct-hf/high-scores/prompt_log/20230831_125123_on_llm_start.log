Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)
- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

def get_high_score(self):
    return max(self.scores)

def get_last_score(self):
    return self.scores[-1]

def get_top_scores(self, n):
    return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:n]
[/PYTHON]
####

Explanation:

I added three methods to the `HighScores` class:

* `get_high_score()`: This method returns the highest score from the list of scores.
* `get_last_score()`: This method returns the last added score.
* `get_top_scores(n)`: This method returns a list of the top `n` scores, sorted in descending order.

I used the built-in `max()` function to get the highest score, and the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the scores in descending order.

I also added a new file, `high_scores.py`, which contains the `HighScores` class and its methods.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.
