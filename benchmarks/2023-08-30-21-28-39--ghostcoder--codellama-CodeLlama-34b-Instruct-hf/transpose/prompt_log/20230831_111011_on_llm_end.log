 I have modified the `transpose.py` file to include a function called `transpose` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings as output. The function transposes the input text by padding the left with spaces and not padding the right.

Here is the updated `transpose.py` file:
```python
def transpose(lines):
    # Calculate the maximum length of the input lines
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)

    # Initialize an empty list to store the transposed lines
    transposed_lines = []

    # Loop through each line in the input
    for line in lines:
        # Pad the line with spaces to the left to match the maximum length
        padded_line = line.rjust(max_length)

        # Split the padded line into a list of characters
        char_list = list(padded_line)

        # Add the list of characters to the transposed lines list
        transposed_lines.append(char_list)

    # Return the transposed lines list
    return transposed_lines
```
I have also added a unit test to the `test_transpose.py` file to test the `transpose` function:
```python
def test_transpose():
    # Test the transpose function with a simple input
    input_lines = ["ABC", "DEF"]
    expected_output = ["AD", "BE", "CF"]
    assert transpose(input_lines) == expected_output

    # Test the transpose function with a more complex input
    input_lines = ["AB", "DEF"]
    expected_output = ["AD", "BE", "F"]
    assert transpose(input_lines) == expected_output
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
