 I have refactored the code to make it more readable and maintainable. Here are the changes I made:

1. I removed the unnecessary `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the end of the file. This block was not being used and was causing confusion.
2. I renamed the `LedgerEntry` class to `Entry` and moved it to its own file. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.
3. I added type hints to the `Entry` class to make it easier to understand the data types being used.
4. I removed the `create_entry` function and replaced it with a constructor for the `Entry` class. This makes the code more consistent and easier to understand.
5. I renamed the `format_entries` function to `format_ledger` to make it more descriptive.
6. I added a docstring to the `format_ledger` function to describe what it does and how it should be used.
7. I removed the `if locale == 'en_US':` block and replaced it with a more general approach that uses the `locale` parameter to determine the formatting of the date and currency.
8. I added a new function called `format_date` that takes a `date` object and a `locale` string as input and returns a formatted date string. This function is used to format the date in the ledger.
9. I added a new function called `format_currency` that takes a `currency` string and a `locale` string as input and returns a formatted currency string. This function is used to format the currency in the ledger.
10. I removed the `if currency == 'USD':` block and replaced it with a more general approach that uses the `currency` parameter to determine the formatting of the currency.
11. I added a new function called `format_change` that takes a `change` float and a `currency` string as input and returns a formatted change string. This function is used to format the change in the ledger.
12. I removed the `if change < 0:` block and replaced it with a more general approach that uses the `change` parameter to determine the formatting of the change.
13. I added a new function called `format_description` that takes a `description` string and a `locale` string as input and returns a formatted description string. This function is used to format the description in the ledger.
14. I removed the `if len(description) > 25:` block and replaced it with a more general approach that uses the `description` parameter to determine the formatting of the description.
15. I added a new function called `format_table` that takes a list of `Entry` objects and a `locale` string as input and returns a formatted table string. This function is used to format the ledger.
16. I removed the `while len(entries) > 0:` block and replaced it with a more general approach that uses the `entries` parameter to determine the formatting of the ledger.
17. I added a new function called `format_entry` that takes an `Entry` object and a `locale` string as input and returns a formatted entry string. This function is used to format each entry in the ledger.
18. I removed the `table` variable and replaced it with a more descriptive variable name `ledger`.
19. I removed the `return table` statement and replaced it with a more descriptive `return ledger` statement.
19. I removed the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block and replaced it with a more descriptive `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
20. I removed the `import datetime` statement and replaced it with a more descriptive `from datetime import datetime` statement.

Here is the updated code:
