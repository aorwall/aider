You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path

Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.

# Instructions

The dice game [Yacht][yacht] is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.
In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered in any of twelve categories.
The score of a throw of the dice depends on category chosen.

## Scores in Yacht

| Category | Score | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| Ones | 1 × number of ones | Any combination | 1 1 1 4 5 scores 3 |
| Twos | 2 × number of twos | Any combination | 2 2 3 4 5 scores 4 |
| Threes | 3 × number of threes | Any combination | 3 3 3 3 3 scores 15 |
| Fours | 4 × number of fours | Any combination | 1 2 3 3 5 scores 0 |
| Fives | 5 × number of fives| Any combination | 5 1 5 2 5 scores 15 |
| Sixes | 6 × number of sixes | Any combination | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 6 |
| Full House | Total of the dice | Three of one number and two of another | 3 3 3 5 5 scores 19 |
| Four of a Kind | Total of the four dice | At least four dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 6 scores 16 |
| Little Straight |  30 points | 1-2-3-4-5 | 1 2 3 4 5 scores 30 |
| Big Straight | 30 points | 2-3-4-5-6 | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 30 |
| Choice | Sum of the dice | Any combination | 2 3 3 4 6 scores 18 |
| Yacht | 50 points | All five dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 4 scores 50 |

If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of a category, the score is zero.
If, for example, *Four Of A Kind* is entered in the *Yacht* category, zero points are scored.
A *Yacht* scores zero if entered in the *Full House* category.

## Task

Given a list of values for five dice and a category, your solution should return the score of the dice for that category.
If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of the category your solution should return 0.
You can assume that five values will always be presented, and the value of each will be between one and six inclusively.
You should not assume that the dice are ordered.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: yacht.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have modified the `yacht.py` file to include the `score` function that takes in a list of five dice values and a category as input and returns the score for that category.

Here is the updated `yacht.py` file:</s>

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in yacht.py to resolve the errors.
