 Here is the modified code for the `resistor_color_trio.py` file:
```python
def label(colors):
    # Initialize the resistance value to 0
    resistance = 0

    # Iterate through the colors and calculate the resistance value
    for color in colors:
        # Convert the color to a number
        number = color_to_number(color)

        # Add the number to the resistance value
        resistance += number

    # Calculate the number of zeros to add to the resistance value
    zeros = len(colors) - 1

    # Add the zeros to the resistance value
    resistance *= 10 ** zeros

    # Return the resistance value as a string with the unit "ohms"
    return f"{resistance} ohms"

def color_to_number(color):
    # Convert the color to a number
    if color == "black":
        return 0
    elif color == "brown":
        return 1
    elif color == "red":
        return 2
    elif color == "orange":
        return 3
    elif color == "yellow":
        return 4
    elif color == "green":
        return 5
    elif color == "blue":
        return 6
    elif color == "violet":
        return 7
    elif color == "grey":
        return 8
    elif color == "white":
        return 9
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid color")
```
In this modified code, the `label` function has been updated to calculate the resistance value and the number of zeros to add to it. The `color_to_number` function has been added to convert the color to a number. The `label` function now returns the resistance value as a string with the unit "ohms".

The `color_to_number` function takes a color as input and returns the corresponding number. The function uses a series of `if` statements to check the color and return the corresponding number. If the color is not valid, the function raises a `ValueError` exception.

The `label` function has been updated to use the `color_to_number` function to convert the colors to numbers. The function first initializes the resistance value to 0 and then iterates through the colors, adding the corresponding number to the resistance value. The function then calculates the number of zeros to add to the resistance value and adds them to the resistance value. Finally, the function returns the resistance value as a string with the unit "ohms".

The modified code should now be able to handle the input of three colors and return the correct resistance value in ohms.
