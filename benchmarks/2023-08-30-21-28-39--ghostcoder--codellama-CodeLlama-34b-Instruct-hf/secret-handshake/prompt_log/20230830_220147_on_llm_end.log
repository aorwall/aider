 The issue with the code is that it is trying to access an index in the list that does not exist. The list `["wink", "double blink", "close your eyes", "jump"]` has 4 elements, but the code is trying to access the 5th element (index 4) when `i` is equal to 4.

To fix the issue, you can change the code to use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around to the beginning of the list when `i` is greater than the length of the list. Here's the updated code:
```python
def commands(binary_str):
    actions = []
    for i in range(len(binary_str)):
        if binary_str[i] == "1":
            actions.append(["wink", "double blink", "close your eyes", "jump"][i % len(actions)])
    if "10000" in binary_str:
        actions.reverse()
    return actions
```
This will ensure that the code always accesses a valid index in the list, and the tests should now pass.
