 I have modified the `secret_handshake.py` file to include the `commands` function that takes a binary string as input and returns a list of actions in the secret handshake.

Here is the updated file:
```
def commands(binary_str):
    actions = []
    for i in range(len(binary_str)):
        if binary_str[i] == "1":
            actions.append(["wink", "double blink", "close your eyes", "jump"][i])
    if "10000" in binary_str:
        actions.reverse()
    return actions
```
I have also added a new test case to the `test_secret_handshake.py` file to test the `commands` function with the input "10000":
```
def test_commands_10000():
    assert commands("10000") == ["jump", "double blink", "wink"]
```
I have also updated the `README.md` file to include a brief description of the secret handshake and the instructions for using the `commands` function.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
