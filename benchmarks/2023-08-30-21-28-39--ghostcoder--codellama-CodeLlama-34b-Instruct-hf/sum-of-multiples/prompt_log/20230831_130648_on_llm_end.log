```python
def sum_of_multiples(level, factors):
    multiples = []
    for factor in factors:
        for i in range(1, level // factor + 1):
            multiples.append(factor * i)
    return sum(set(multiples))
```
Explanation:
In the `sum_of_multiples` function, we first initialize an empty list `multiples` to store the multiples of each factor.
We then iterate through each factor in the `factors` list, and for each factor, we use a nested for-loop to calculate the multiples of that factor that are less than the level number.
We use the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to the quotient of the level number and the factor, and then multiply each number in the sequence by the factor to get the multiples.
We then append the multiples to the `multiples` list.
After iterating through all the factors, we return the sum of the unique elements in the `multiples` list using the `set` function to remove duplicates.

I updated the existing file.
Filepath: sum_of_multiples.py

        for i in range(1, level // factor + 1):
            multiples.append(factor * i)
    return sum(set(multiples))
```
