<s>[INST]<<SYS>>
Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code.

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: file_path
```language
code
```


Examples:
[INST]Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n as an argument and calculates the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```[/INST] Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
I added a new file.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.
It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write "the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.
You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

# Instructions append

## Python Special Instructions

A third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.
raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
[/INST] I have updated the `hangman.py` file with the necessary changes to implement the game logic using functional reactive programming.

Here is the updated file:</s>
<s>[INST]Filepath: hangman.py
```python
# Game status categories
# Change the values as you see fit
STATUS_WIN = 'win'
STATUS_LOSE = 'lose'
STATUS_ONGOING = 'ongoing'


class Hangman:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.remaining_guesses = 9
        self.status = STATUS_ONGOING
        self.word = word
        self.masked_word = '_' * len(word)

    def guess(self, char):
        if self.status != STATUS_ONGOING:
            raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")

        if char in self.word:
            self.masked_word = self.masked_word.replace(char, char)
            if self.masked_word == self.word:
                self.status = STATUS_WIN
        else:
            self.remaining_guesses -= 1
            if self.remaining_guesses == 0:
                self.status = STATUS_LOSE

    def get_masked_word(self):
        return self.masked_word

    def get_status(self):
        return self.status

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in hangman.py to resolve the errors.
