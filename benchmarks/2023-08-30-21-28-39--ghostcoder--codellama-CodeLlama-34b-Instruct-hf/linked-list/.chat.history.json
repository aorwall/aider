When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\nThis makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\nFor situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][error types], but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise] to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when a node value being `delete()`-ed is not found in the linked list.\nAdditionally, an `IndexError` should be thrown if there are no nodes left to `pop()`.\nThe tests will only pass if you both `raise` these `exceptions` and include messages with them.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# When the value passed to `delete()` is not found.\nif not found:\n    raise ValueError(\"Value not found\")\n\n```\n\nTo raise an `IndexError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# When pop() is called and there are no nodes left in the linked list\nif self.length == 0:\n    raise IndexError(\"List is empty\")\n\n```\n\n\n## Special Methods in Python\n\nThe tests for this exercise will also be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\nIn order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\nFor details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.__len__(self)][__len__].\n\nWe also recommend creating a special [`__iter__`][__iter__] method to help with iterating over your linked list.\n\n<br>\n\n[__iter__]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__\n[__len__]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__\n[basic customization]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization\n[error types]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes\n[raise]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\n[raising]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: linked_list.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
