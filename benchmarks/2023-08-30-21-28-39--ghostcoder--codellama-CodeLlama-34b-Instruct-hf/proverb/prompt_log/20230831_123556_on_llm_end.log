 The issue is that the `proverb` function does not accept a `qualifier` argument, but the test cases are passing a `qualifier` argument to the function.

To fix the issue, you can add a `qualifier` parameter to the `proverb` function, like this:
```
def proverb(qualifier, *input_data):
    # ...
```
This will allow the function to accept a `qualifier` argument, which can be used to modify the final consequence of the proverb.

Alternatively, you can remove the `qualifier` argument from the test cases, so that the function is only called with the `input_data` argument. This will make the tests pass, but it may not be the desired behavior for the function.
