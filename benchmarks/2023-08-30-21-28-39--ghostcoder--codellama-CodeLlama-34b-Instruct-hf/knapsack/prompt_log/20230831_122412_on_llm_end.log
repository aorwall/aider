 The issue with the code is that it is not handling the case where the weight of the items is greater than the capacity of the knapsack. In this case, the code is trying to access the value of the item with weight greater than the capacity, which is not present in the dictionary.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check before accessing the value of the item to make sure that the weight of the item is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. If the weight of the item is greater than the capacity, we can return the maximum value that can be obtained with the remaining items.

Here's the updated code:
```python
def maximum_value(W, items):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the maximum value for each weight
    dp = {0: 0}
    for item in items:
        # Loop through the items and update the dictionary
        for w in range(W + 1):
            if w < item["weight"]:
                dp[w] = dp.get(w, 0)
            else:
                if item["weight"] <= W:
                    dp[w] = max(dp.get(w, 0), dp.get(w - item["weight"], 0) + item["value"])
                else:
                    return dp[W]
    return dp[W]
```
In this updated code, we added an if-else statement to check if the weight of the item is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. If the weight is greater than the capacity, we return the maximum value that can be obtained with the remaining items.

With this fix, the code should pass all the test cases.
