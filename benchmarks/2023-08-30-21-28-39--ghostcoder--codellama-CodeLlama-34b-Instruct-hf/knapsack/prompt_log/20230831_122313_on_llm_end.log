def maximum_value(W, items):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the maximum value for each weight
    dp = {0: 0}
    for item in items:
        # Loop through the items and update the dictionary
        for w in range(W + 1):
            if w < item["weight"]:
                dp[w] = dp.get(w, 0)
            else:
                dp[w] = max(dp.get(w, 0), dp.get(w - item["weight"], 0) + item["value"])
    return dp[W]
```
Explanation:
In the `maximum_value` function, we first initialize a dictionary `dp` to store the maximum value for each weight.
We then loop through the items and update the dictionary using the following recurrence relation:

dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - item["weight"]] + item["value"])

This recurrence relation ensures that we are always choosing the item with the highest value for each weight.
Finally, we return the maximum value for the given weight limit `W`.

Note that we use the `get` method with a default value of 0 to handle the case where the weight is less than the item's weight.
This ensures that we don't try to access a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary.
