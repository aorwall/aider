In this case, the code is trying to access the value of the item with weight greater than the capacity, which is not present in the dictionary.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add a check before accessing the value of the item to make sure that the weight of the item is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. If the weight of the item is greater than the capacity, we can return the maximum value that can be obtained with the remaining items.\n\nHere's the updated code:",
