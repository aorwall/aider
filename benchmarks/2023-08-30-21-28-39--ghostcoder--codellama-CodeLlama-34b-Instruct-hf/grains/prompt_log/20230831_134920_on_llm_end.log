 Here is the updated code for the grains.py file:
```python
def square(number):
    """
    Calculates the number of grains of wheat on a given square of a chessboard.
    """
    if number < 1 or number > 64:
        raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
    return 2 ** (number - 1)

def total():
    """
    Calculates the total number of grains of wheat on a chessboard.
    """
    return sum(square(i) for i in range(1, 65))
```
I added a docstring to the `square` function to explain what it does, and I also added a docstring to the `total` function to explain what it does. I also added a `ValueError` exception to the `square` function to handle the case where the input is not between 1 and 64.

I also updated the `total` function to use a generator expression to calculate the sum of the grains on each square, and I removed the `print` statement that was previously there.

I did not modify the `tests.py` file, as it was not necessary for this exercise.
