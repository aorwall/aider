 The issue is that the `dot_dsl` module is not properly importing the `NODE` and `EDGE` constants from the `dot_dsl` module.

To fix this, you can add the following lines to the top of the `dot_dsl.py` file:
```python
from dot_dsl import NODE, EDGE
```
This will import the `NODE` and `EDGE` constants from the `dot_dsl` module, and make them available for use in the `dot_dsl_test` module.

With this change, the tests should now pass.
