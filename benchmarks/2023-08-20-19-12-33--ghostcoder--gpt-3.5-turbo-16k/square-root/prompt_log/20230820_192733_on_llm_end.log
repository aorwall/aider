```python
def square_root(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number")
    if number == 0:
        return 0

    guess = number / 2
    while True:
        new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2
        if abs(guess - new_guess) < 1e-6:
            return new_guess
        guess = new_guess
```

Explanation:
- Added a check to raise a ValueError if the input number is negative.
- Added a check to return 0 if the input number is 0.
- Implemented the Babylonian method to calculate the square root of a positive number. The method uses an initial guess and iteratively refines the guess until the difference between the guess and the new guess is within a certain tolerance (1e-6 in this case).
