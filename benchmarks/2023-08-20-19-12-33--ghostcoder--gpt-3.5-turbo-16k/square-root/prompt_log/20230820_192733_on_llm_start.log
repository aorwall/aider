Human: # Instructions

Given a natural radicand, return its square root.

Note that the term "radicand" refers to the number for which the root is to be determined.
That is, it is the number under the root symbol.

Check out the Wikipedia pages on [square root][square-root] and [methods of computing square roots][computing-square-roots].

Recall also that natural numbers are positive real whole numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and up).

## How this Exercise is Structured in Python


Python offers a wealth of mathematical functions in the form of the [math module][math-module] and built-ins such as [`pow()`][pow] and [`sum()`][sum].
However, we'd like you to consider the challenge of solving this exercise without those built-ins or modules.

While there is a mathematical formula that will find the square root of _any_ number, we have gone the route of only testing [natural numbers][nautral-number] (positive integers).

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: square_root.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```python
def square_root(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number")
    if number == 0:
        return 0

    guess = number / 2
    while True:
        new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2
        if abs(guess - new_guess) < 1e-6:
            return new_guess
        guess = new_guess
```
Explanation:
- Added a check to raise a ValueError if the input number is negative.
- Added a check to return 0 if the input number is 0.
- Implemented the Babylonian method to calculate the square root of a positive number. The method uses an initial guess and iteratively refines the guess until the difference between the guess and the new guess is within a certain tolerance (1e-6 in this case).

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in square_root.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number")
    if number == 0:
        return 0

    guess = number / 2
    while True:
        new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2
        if abs(guess - new_guess) < 1e-6:
            return new_guess
        guess = new_guess
```
