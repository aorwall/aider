System: Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code. 

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment. 
* YOU MUST include the definitions of parent classes and functions.

* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

Human: # Instructions

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;
the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the slice length is zero.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")

# if the slice length is negative.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")

# if the series provided is empty.
raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

# if the slice length is longer than the series.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    pass

```
