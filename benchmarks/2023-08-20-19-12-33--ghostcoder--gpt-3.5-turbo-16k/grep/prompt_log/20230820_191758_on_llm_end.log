Explanation:
- I added the `re` module to use regular expressions for pattern matching.
- I implemented the `grep` function according to the instructions.
- I added three helper functions: `match_line`, `format_line`, and `grep`.
- The `match_line` function checks if a line matches the pattern based on the flags.
- The `format_line` function formats the line based on the flags.
- The `grep` function reads the contents of the specified files, finds the lines that contain the search string, and returns those lines in the order in which they were found.
