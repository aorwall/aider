The first killer cage is in the 3\u00d73 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3\u00d73 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3\u00d73 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]\n\n## Example 2: Cage with several combinations\n\nIn a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:\n\n- 19\n- 28\n- 37\n- 46\n\n![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]\n\n## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted\n\nIn a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:\n\n- 28\n- 37\n\n19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.\n\n![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]\n\n## Trying it yourself\n\nIf you want to give an approachable Killer Sudoku a go, you can try out [this puzzle][clover-puzzle] by Clover, featured by [Mark Goodliffe on Cracking The Cryptic on the 21st of June 2021][goodliffe-video].\n\nYou can also find Killer Sudokus in varying difficulty in numerous newspapers, as well as Sudoku apps, books and websites.\n\n## Credit\n\nThe screenshots above have been generated using [F-Puzzles.com](https://www.f-puzzles.com/), a Puzzle Setting Tool by Eric Fox.\n\n[sudoku-rules]: https://masteringsudoku.com/sudoku-rules-beginners/\n[killer-guide]: https://masteringsudoku.com/killer-sudoku/\n[one-solution-img]: https://exercism-v3-icons.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example1.png\n[four-solutions-img]: https://exercism-v3-icons.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example2.png\n[not-possible-img]: https://exercism-v3-icons.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example3.png\n[clover-puzzle]: https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/HqTBn3Pr6R\n[goodliffe-video]: https://youtu.be/c_NjEbFEeW0?t=1180\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: killer_sudoku_helper.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
