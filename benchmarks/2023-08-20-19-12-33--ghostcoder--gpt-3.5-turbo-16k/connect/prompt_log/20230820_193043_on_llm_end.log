Explanation:
- I added the implementation of the `ConnectGame` class.
- In the `__init__` method, I added a line to store the `board` parameter as an instance variable.
- In the `get_winner` method, I implemented the logic to check if player O has won by connecting top and bottom, and if player X has won by connecting left and right.
- I added a helper method `dfs` to perform a depth-first search to check for a connection from the starting position to the opposite side.
- I used a set `visited` to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting the same position.
- If a connection is found, the method returns True, indicating that the player has won.
- If no winner is found, the method returns None.
