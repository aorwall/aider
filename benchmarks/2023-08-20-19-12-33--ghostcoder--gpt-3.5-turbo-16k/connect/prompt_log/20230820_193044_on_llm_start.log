Human: # Instructions

Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.

The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.
Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.
The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.
The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).

Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).
Note that all games need not be "fair".
(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)

The boards look like this:

```text
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X
```

"Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.
In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: connect.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def get_winner(self):
        # Check if player O has won by connecting top and bottom
        for col in range(len(self.board[0])):
            if self.board[0][col] == 'O':
                if self.dfs(0, col, 'O', set()):
                    return 'O'

        # Check if player X has won by connecting left and right
        for row in range(len(self.board)):
            if self.board[row][0] == 'X':
                if self.dfs(row, 0, 'X', set()):
                    return 'X'

        # No winner
        return None

    def dfs(self, row, col, player, visited):
        if row < 0 or row >= len(self.board) or col < 0 or col >= len(self.board[0]):
            return False

        if (row, col) in visited:
            return False

        if self.board[row][col] != player:
            return False

        if player == 'O' and row == len(self.board) - 1:
            return True

        if player == 'X' and col == len(self.board[0]) - 1:
            return True

        visited.add((row, col))

        return (
            self.dfs(row - 1, col, player, visited) or
            self.dfs(row + 1, col, player, visited) or
            self.dfs(row, col - 1, player, visited) or
            self.dfs(row, col + 1, player, visited) or
            self.dfs(row - 1, col + 1, player, visited) or
            self.dfs(row + 1, col - 1, player, visited)
        )
```
Explanation:
- I added the implementation of the `ConnectGame` class.
- In the `__init__` method, I added a line to store the `board` parameter as an instance variable.
- In the `get_winner` method, I implemented the logic to check if player O has won by connecting top and bottom, and if player X has won by connecting left and right.
- I added a helper method `dfs` to perform a depth-first search to check for a connection from the starting position to the opposite side.
- I used a set `visited` to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting the same position.
- If a connection is found, the method returns True, indicating that the player has won.
- If no winner is found, the method returns None.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in connect.py to resolve the errors.
