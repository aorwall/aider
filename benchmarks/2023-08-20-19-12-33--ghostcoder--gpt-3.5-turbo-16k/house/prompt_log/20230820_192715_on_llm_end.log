prompt:
I apologize for the mistake. I have reviewed the code and found the issue. The problem lies in the way the phrases are joined together in the verse. The newline character `\n` is causing the mismatch in the test cases. To fix this, we can remove the newline character and add a space instead.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: house.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    phrases = [
        "the house that Jack built.",
        "the malt that lay in ",
        "the rat that ate ",
        "the cat that killed ",
        "the dog that worried ",
        "the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed ",
        "the maiden all forlorn that milked ",
        "the man all tattered and torn that kissed ",
        "the priest all shaven and shorn that married ",
        "the rooster that crowed in the morn that woke ",
        "the farmer sowing his corn that kept ",
        "the horse and the hound and the horn that belonged to "
    ]

    verses = []
    for i in range(start_verse, end_verse + 1):
        verse = "This is " + phrases[i-1]
        for j in range(i-2, -1, -1):
            verse += phrases[j]
        verses.append(verse)

    return verses
```

Please try running the tests again and let me know if the issue is resolved.
