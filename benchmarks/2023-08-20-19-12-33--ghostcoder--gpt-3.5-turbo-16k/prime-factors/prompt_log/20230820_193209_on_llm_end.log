Filepath: prime_factors.py
```python
def factors(value):
    prime_factors = []
    divisor = 2

    while value > 1:
        if value % divisor == 0:
            prime_factors.append(divisor)
            value = value / divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1

    return prime_factors
```

Explanation:
- I added a variable `prime_factors` to store the prime factors of the given value.
- I initialized `divisor` to 2, which is the smallest prime number.
- I used a while loop to iterate until the value becomes 1.
- Inside the loop, I checked if the value is divisible by the current divisor.
- If it is divisible, I added the divisor to the `prime_factors` list and updated the value by dividing it by the divisor.
- If it is not divisible, I incremented the divisor by 1.
- Finally, I returned the `prime_factors` list.
