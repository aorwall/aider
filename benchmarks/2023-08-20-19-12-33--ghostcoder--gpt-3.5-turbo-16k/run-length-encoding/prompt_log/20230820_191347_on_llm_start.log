Human: # Instructions

Implement run-length encoding and decoding.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data elements) are replaced by just one data value and count.

For example we can represent the original 53 characters with only 13.

```text
"WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"  ->  "12WB12W3B24WB"
```

RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, which makes it a lossless data compression.

```text
"AABCCCDEEEE"  ->  "2AB3CD4E"  ->  "AABCCCDEEEE"
```

For simplicity, you can assume that the unencoded string will only contain the letters A through Z (either lower or upper case) and whitespace.
This way data to be encoded will never contain any numbers and numbers inside data to be decoded always represent the count for the following character.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: run_length_encoding.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

def decode(string):

            count += char
        else:

                count = "1"
            decoded_string += char * int(count)

            count = 1
    if count > 1:
        encoded_string += str(count)
    encoded_string += string[-1]

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in run_length_encoding.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: run_length_encoding.py
```python
def decode(string):
    decoded_string = ""
    count = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.isdigit():
            count += char
        else:
            if count == "":
                count = "1"
            decoded_string += char * int(count)
            count = ""
    return decoded_string


def encode(string):
    encoded_string = ""
    count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(string)):
        if string[i] == string[i-1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            if count > 1:
                encoded_string += str(count)
            encoded_string += string[i-1]
            count = 1
    if count > 1:
        encoded_string += str(count)
    encoded_string += string[-1]
    return encoded_string
```
