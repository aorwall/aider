Human: # Instructions

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.
Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: diamond.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows in the diamond
    num_rows = (ord(letter) - ord('A')) * 2 + 1

    # Create an empty list to store the rows
    diamond = []

    # Iterate through each row
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Calculate the distance from the middle row
        distance = abs(i - (num_rows // 2))

        # Calculate the letter for the current row
        current_letter = chr(ord('A') + distance)

        # Calculate the number of spaces before and after the letter
        num_spaces = num_rows // 2 - distance

        # Create the row string with the appropriate number of spaces and letters
        row = ' ' * num_spaces + current_letter + ' ' * num_spaces

        # Add the row to the diamond list
        diamond.append(row)

    # Return the diamond as a list of rows
    return diamond
```
Explanation:
- I added code to calculate the number of rows in the diamond based on the input letter.
- I created an empty list to store the rows of the diamond.
- I iterated through each row and calculated the distance from the middle row.
- I calculated the letter for the current row based on the distance.
- I calculated the number of spaces before and after the letter.
- I created the row string with the appropriate number of spaces and letters.
- I added the row to the diamond list.
- I returned the diamond as a list of rows.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in diamond.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows in the diamond
    num_rows = (ord(letter) - ord('A')) * 2 + 1

    diamond = []

    # Iterate through each row

        distance = abs(i - (num_rows // 2))

        # Calculate the letter for the current row
        current_letter = chr(ord('A') + distance)
