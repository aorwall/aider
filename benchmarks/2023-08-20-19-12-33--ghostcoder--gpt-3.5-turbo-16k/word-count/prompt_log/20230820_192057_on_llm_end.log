prompt:
I apologize for the mistakes in the code. I have reviewed the test cases and identified the issues. Here's the updated code:

Filepath: word_count.py
```python
import re

def count_words(sentence):
    # Convert the sentence to lowercase
    sentence = sentence.lower()

    # Replace all punctuation marks with whitespace
    sentence = re.sub(r"[^\w\s']", " ", sentence)

    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Count the occurrences of each word
    word_count = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in word_count:
            word_count[word] += 1
        else:
            word_count[word] = 1

    return word_count
```

I have made the following changes:
- Imported the `re` module to use regular expressions for replacing punctuation marks.
- Used the `re.sub()` function to replace all punctuation marks (except apostrophes) with whitespace.
- Removed the loop that iterated over each character in the sentence and replaced it with a single line using regular expressions.

This updated code should resolve the test failures.
