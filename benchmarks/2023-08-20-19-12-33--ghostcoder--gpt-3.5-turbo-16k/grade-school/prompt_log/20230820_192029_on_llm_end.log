Explanation:
- Added an instance variable `students` to the `School` class to store the students' names and grades.
- In the `add_student` method, if the grade already exists in the `students` dictionary, the student's name is appended to the list of names for that grade. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the `students` dictionary with the grade as the key and a list containing the student's name as the value.
- In the `roster` method, the students' names are sorted by grade and then alphabetically within each grade. The sorted names are stored in the `sorted_students` list and returned.
- In the `grade` method, if the grade exists in the `students` dictionary, the names for that grade are sorted and returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.
- In the `added` method, the `students` dictionary is returned as is.
