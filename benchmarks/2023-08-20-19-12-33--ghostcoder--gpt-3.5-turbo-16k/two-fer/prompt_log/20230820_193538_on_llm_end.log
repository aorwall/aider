I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the test is expecting the `two_fer()` function to be called without any arguments. To fix this, we can modify the function to have a default value for the `name` parameter. 

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: two_fer.py
```python
def two_fer(name="you"):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```

Now, the `two_fer()` function can be called without any arguments, and it will default to using "you" as the name.
