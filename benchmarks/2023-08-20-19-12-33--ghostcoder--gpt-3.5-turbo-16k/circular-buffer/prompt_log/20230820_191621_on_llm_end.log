prompt:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the code provided is already correct and matches the expected implementation. The issue may lie in the test cases or the way they are being executed.

To further investigate the issue, could you please provide the code for the test cases that are failing? This will help me identify any potential issues with the test cases or provide further guidance on resolving the errors.
