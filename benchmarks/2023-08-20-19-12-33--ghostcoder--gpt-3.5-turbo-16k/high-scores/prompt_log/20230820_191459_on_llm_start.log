Human: # Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: high_scores.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def highest(self):
        highest_score = max(self.scores)
        return highest_score

    def last_added(self):
        last_score = self.scores[-1]
        return last_score

    def top_three(self):
        sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)
        top_three_scores = sorted_scores[:3]
        return top_three_scores
```
Explanation: 
- Added the `__init__` method to initialize the `scores` attribute.
- Implemented the `highest` method to return the highest score from the list by using the `max` function.
- Implemented the `last_added` method to return the last added score from the list by accessing the last element using the index `[-1]`.
- Implemented the `top_three` method to return the three highest scores from the list by sorting the scores in descending order using the `sorted` function and then slicing the first three elements using the `[:3]` notation.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def highest(self):
        highest_score = max(self.scores)
        return highest_score

    def last_added(self):
        last_score = self.scores[-1]
        return last_score

    def top_three(self):
        sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)
        top_three_scores = sorted_scores[:3]
        return top_three_scores
```
