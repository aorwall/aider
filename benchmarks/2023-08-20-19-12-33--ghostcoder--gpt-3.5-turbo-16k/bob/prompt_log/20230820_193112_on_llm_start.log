Human: # Introduction

Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.
He likes to think that he's very cool.
And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.
That wouldn't be cool.

When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: bob.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.strip() == "":
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    elif hey_bob.isupper() and hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Sure."
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```
- I added an if-elif-else statement to check the different conditions for Bob's responses.
- I used the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.
- I used the `isupper()` method to check if the input string is in all capital letters.
- I used the `endswith()` method to check if the input string ends with a question mark.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bob.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.strip() == "":
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    elif hey_bob.isupper() and hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob.endswith("?"):
        return "Sure."
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```
