When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n\nCustom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n\nFor situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n\nTo customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\nclass MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n\n    message: explanation of the error.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n        \n# raising a MeetupDayException\nraise MeetupDayException(\"That day does not exist.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
