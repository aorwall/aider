I apologize for the mistake. The issue is that the regular expression used to remove punctuation is also removing underscores, which is causing the test case to fail. To fix this, we can modify the regular expression to exclude underscores. 

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: acronym.py
```python
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    # Remove all punctuation except hyphens and underscores
    words = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', words)
    
    # Split the words by whitespace and hyphens
    words = re.split(r'[\s-]+', words)
    
    # Get the first letter of each word and convert to uppercase
    acronym = [word[0].upper() for word in words]
    
    # Join the letters to form the acronym
    acronym = ''.join(acronym)
    
    return acronym
```

This should resolve the issue with the failing test case.
