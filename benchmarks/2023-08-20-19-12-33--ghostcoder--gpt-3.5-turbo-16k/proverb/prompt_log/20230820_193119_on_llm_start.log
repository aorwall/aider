You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment.

Human: # Instructions

For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.

Given a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb.
For example, given the list `["nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"]`, you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
```

Note that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content.
No line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.
# Instructions append

In [concept:python/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment](https://github.com/exercism/python/tree/main/concepts/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment), you learned multiple techniques for working with `lists`/`tuples` of arbitrary length as well as function arguments of arbitrary length.
This exercise would be a great place to practice those techniques.

## How this exercise is implemented for Python

The test cases for this track add an additional keyword argument called `qualifier`.
You should use this keyword arguments value to modify the final verse of your Proverb.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: proverb.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: proverb.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: proverb.py
```python
def proverb(qualifier, *words):
    lines = []
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        lines.append(f"For want of a {words[i]} the {words[i+1]} was lost.")
    if words:
        lines.append(f"And all for the want of a {qualifier} {words[0]}.")
    return "
".join(lines)
```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in proverb.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: proverb.py
```python
def proverb(qualifier, *words):
    lines = []
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        lines.append(f"For want of a {words[i]} the {words[i+1]} was lost.")
    if words:
        lines.append(f"And all for the want of a {qualifier} {words[0]}.")
    return "
".join(lines)
```
