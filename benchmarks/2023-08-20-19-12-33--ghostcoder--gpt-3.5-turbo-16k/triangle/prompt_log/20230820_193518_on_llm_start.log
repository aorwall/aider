Human: # Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in triangle.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    if len(set(sides)) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False


def isosceles(sides):
    if len(set(sides)) <= 2:
        return True
    else:
        return False


def scalene(sides):
    if len(set(sides)) == 3:
        return True
    else:
        return False
