The test cases are failing because the code does not handle the cases where the resistance value is in the megaohms or gigaohms range. We need to add conditions to check if the resistance value is 1,000,000 (1 million) or more, in which case we should use the "megaohms" unit, and if it's 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) or more, in which case we should use the "gigaohms" unit.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: resistor_color_trio.py
```python
def label(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    value = (color_codes[colors[0]] * 10 + color_codes[colors[1]]) * (10 ** color_codes[colors[2]])

    if value >= 1000000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000000} gigaohms"
    elif value >= 1000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000} megaohms"
    elif value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
```
In this updated code, we first check if the resistance value is 1 billion or more, in which case we divide it by 1 billion and append "gigaohms" to the result. If it's not, we check if it's 1 million or more, in which case we divide it by 1 million and append "megaohms" to the result. If it's not, we check if it's 1000 or more, in which case we divide it by 1000 and append "kiloohms" to the result. If it's less than 1000, we simply append "ohms" to the resistance value.
