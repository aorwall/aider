prompt:
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from each domino, and try to form a chain by exploring each possibility. If we can form a chain where the first and last numbers are the same, we return that chain. If not, we backtrack and try the next possibility.

Here's how we can implement this:

Filepath: dominoes.py
```python
def can_chain(dominoes):
    if not dominoes:
        return []

    # Try to start the chain from each domino
    for i in range(len(dominoes)):
        chain = dfs(dominoes[:i] + dominoes[i+1:], [dominoes[i]])
        if chain:
            return chain

    return []

def dfs(remaining, chain):
    # If there are no remaining dominoes and the chain is valid, return the chain
    if not remaining and chain[0][0] == chain[-1][1]:
        return chain

    # Try to add each remaining domino to the chain
    for i in range(len(remaining)):
        domino = remaining[i]
        # If the domino can be added to the chain, add it and continue the search
        if chain[-1][1] == domino[0]:
            result = dfs(remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:], chain + [domino])
            if result:
                return result
        # If the domino can be added to the chain in reverse order, add it and continue the search
        elif chain[-1][1] == domino[1]:
            result = dfs(remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:], chain + [domino[::-1]])
            if result:
                return result

    # If no domino can be added to the chain, return None
    return None
```

In the `can_chain` function, we try to start the chain from each domino. For each starting domino, we call the `dfs` function to try to form a chain.

In the `dfs` function, we first check if there are no remaining dominoes and if the chain is valid (i.e., the first and last numbers are the same). If so, we return the chain. Then, we try to add each remaining domino to the chain. If the domino can be added to the chain (either in its original order or in reverse order), we add it and continue the search. If no domino can be added to the chain, we return None.

This solution works because it explores all possible chains, and returns the first valid chain it finds. If no valid chain can be found, it returns an empty list.
