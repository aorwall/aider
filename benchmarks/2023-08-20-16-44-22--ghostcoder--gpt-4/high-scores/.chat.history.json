Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.\n\n- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)\n- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
