## Chromatic Scales

Scales in Western music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale.
This scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:

> A, A♯, B, C, C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯

A given sharp note (indicated by a ♯) can also be expressed as the flat of the note above it (indicated by a ♭) so the chromatic scale can also be written like this:

> A, B♭, B, C, D♭, D, E♭, E, F, G♭, G, A♭

The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.
They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.
The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).
Here is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:

| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Natural       | C                     | a                    |
| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F♯     | e, b, f♯, c♯, g♯, d♯ |
| Flat          | F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭ | d, g, c, f, b♭, e♭   |

Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes "C" and "a" follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.
For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.

### Task

Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.

- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.
- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.
- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.

## Diatonic Scales

The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.
An interval is the space between two pitches.

The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a "half step", or "minor second" (sometimes written as a lower-case "m").
The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a "whole step" or "major second" (written as an upper-case "M").
The diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.

Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.
An "augmented second" interval, written "A", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D♭ to E) or a "whole step" plus a "half step".
There are also smaller and larger intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.

### Task

Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.

This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning 12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.
The first note is always the given tonic.
Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.

For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:

Note | Reason
--|--
G | Tonic
A | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G♯
B | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A♯
C | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing
D | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C♯
E | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D♯
F♯ | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F
G | m indicates a half step from F♯, skipping nothing

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: scale_generator.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: scale_generator.py
AI: To solve this problem, we need to create a dictionary that maps each note to its corresponding index in the chromatic scale. We also need to create two lists, one for the chromatic scale with sharps and one for the chromatic scale with flats. 

In the `__init__` method, we will initialize the tonic and determine whether to use the sharp or flat chromatic scale based on the tonic. 

In the `chromatic` method, we will find the index of the tonic in the chromatic scale and return the chromatic scale starting from the tonic.

In the `interval` method, we will create a new scale starting from the tonic and following the specified interval pattern. We will use a variable to keep track of the current note and for each interval, we will add the corresponding number of notes to the current note and add the resulting note to the new scale.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: scale_generator.py
```python
class Scale:
    CHROMATIC_SHARP = ['A', 'A#', 'B', 'C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#']
    CHROMATIC_FLAT = ['A', 'Bb', 'B', 'C', 'Db', 'D', 'Eb', 'E', 'F', 'Gb', 'G', 'Ab']
    SHARP_KEYS = ['G', 'D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'F#', 'a', 'e', 'b', 'f#', 'c#', 'g#', 'd#']
    FLAT_KEYS = ['F', 'Bb', 'Eb', 'Ab', 'Db', 'Gb', 'd', 'g', 'c', 'f', 'bb', 'eb']
    INTERVALS = {'m': 1, 'M': 2, 'A': 3}

    def __init__(self, tonic):
        self.tonic = tonic.capitalize()
        if self.tonic in self.SHARP_KEYS:
            self.chromatic_scale = self.CHROMATIC_SHARP
        elif self.tonic in self.FLAT_KEYS:
            self.chromatic_scale = self.CHROMATIC_FLAT
        else:
            self.chromatic_scale = self.CHROMATIC_SHARP if self.tonic.isupper() else self.CHROMATIC_FLAT
        self.tonic_index = self.chromatic_scale.index(self.tonic)

    def chromatic(self):
        return self.chromatic_scale[self.tonic_index:] + self.chromatic_scale[:self.tonic_index]

    def interval(self, intervals):
        scale = [self.tonic]
        index = self.tonic_index
        for interval in intervals[:-1]:  # Exclude the last interval as it leads back to the tonic
            index = (index + self.INTERVALS[interval]) % len(self.chromatic_scale)
            scale.append(self.chromatic_scale[index])
        return scale
```
This code will generate the chromatic and diatonic scales based on the given tonic and interval pattern.
