Human: # Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
def calculate(text_input):
    pass

```
