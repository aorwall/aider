To find the square root of a number without using built-in functions or modules, we can use the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method). This method is an iterative algorithm that can be used to find the square root of a number to a desired precision.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the actual square root of the given number, the better).
2. Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
   a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
   b) Set y = number / x

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    x = number
    y = 1
    precision = 0.000001  # Define the precision to which we want to calculate the square root

    while x - y > precision:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x

    return x
```
In this code, we first check if the number is 0 or 1, because the square root of 0 and 1 is the number itself. Then we initialize x with the number and y with 1. We define a precision to which we want to calculate the square root. We then enter a loop that continues until the difference between x and y is less than the defined precision. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the next approximation for the square root and update x and y accordingly. Finally, we return the calculated square root.
