Human: # Instructions

Convert a trinary number, represented as a string (e.g. '102012'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid trinary as the value 0.

Trinary numbers contain three symbols: 0, 1, and 2.

The last place in a trinary number is the 1's place.
The second to last is the 3's place, the third to last is the 9's place, etc.

```shell
# "102012"
    1       0       2       0       1       2    # the number
1*3^5 + 0*3^4 + 2*3^3 + 0*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0    # the value
  243 +     0 +    54 +     0 +     3 +     2 =  302
```

If your language provides a method in the standard library to perform the conversion, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: trinary.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: trinary.py
AI: To convert a trinary number to its decimal equivalent, we can iterate over the string in reverse order. For each character, we multiply its integer value by 3 raised to the power of its position and add the result to a running total. If we encounter a character that is not a valid trinary digit, we return 0.

Here's how you can implement this in the `trinary` function:
I updated a file.
Filepath: trinary.py
```python
def trinary(string):
    try:
        return sum(int(char) * 3 ** i for i, char in enumerate(string[::-1]))
    except ValueError:
        return 0
```
In this code, `enumerate(string[::-1])` generates pairs of the form `(i, char)`, where `i` is the position of `char` in the reversed string. `int(char) * 3 ** i` converts the trinary digit to its decimal equivalent. If `int(char)` raises a `ValueError` because `char` is not a valid digit, the function returns 0.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in trinary.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: trinary.py
```python
def trinary(string):
    try:
        return sum(int(char) * 3 ** i for i, char in enumerate(string[::-1]))
    except ValueError:
        return 0
```
