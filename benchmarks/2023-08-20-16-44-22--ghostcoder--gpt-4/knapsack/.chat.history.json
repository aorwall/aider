        "text": "This problem is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem known as the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The idea is to build up a table `dp` progressively where `dp[i][j]` will represent the maximum value that can be obtained with a knapsack capacity of `j` and items up to `i`th index.\n\nWe start by initializing a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (W+1)` where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight of the knapsack. All elements of `dp` are initially 0.\n\nThen, for each item, we consider all weights from 0 to `W` (both inclusive). For every weight `w`, we have two options:\n\n1. Don't include the item in the knapsack, in which case the value of `dp[i][w]` will be `dp[i-1][w]` (value of the knapsack with the previous item).\n2. Include the item in the knapsack. In this case, the value of `dp[i][w]` will be `v[i] + dp[i-1][w-w[i]]`, where `v[i]` is the value of the `i`th item and `w[i]` is the weight of the `i`th item. The term `dp[i-1][w-w[i]]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the remaining weight after including the `i`th item.\n\nThe maximum of these two options will be our optimal answer, i.e., `dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], v[i] + dp[i-1][w-w[i]])`.\n\nFinally, `dp[n][W]` will give us the maximum value that can be obtained with a knapsack capacity of `W` and all items.",
