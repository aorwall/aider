In the Hangman class, I have added a new attribute `word` to store the word to be guessed and `guessed_chars` to store the characters that have been guessed. 

In the `guess` method, I have added the logic to handle the guessing of characters. If the game is not ongoing, a ValueError is raised. If the character is not in the word or has already been guessed, the remaining guesses are reduced by 1. The guessed character is then added to `guessed_chars`.

In the `get_masked_word` method, I have added the logic to return the word with all unguessed characters replaced by '_'.

In the `get_status` method, I have added the logic to return the status of the game. If all characters in the word have been guessed, the status is 'win'. If there are no remaining guesses, the status is 'lose'. Otherwise, the status is 'ongoing'.

Filepath: hangman.py
```python
# Game status categories
# Change the values as you see fit
STATUS_WIN = 'win'
STATUS_LOSE = 'lose'
STATUS_ONGOING = 'ongoing'


class Hangman:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.remaining_guesses = 9
        self.status = STATUS_ONGOING
        self.word = word
        self.guessed_chars = set()

    def guess(self, char):
        if self.status != STATUS_ONGOING:
            raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
        if char not in self.word or char in self.guessed_chars:
            self.remaining_guesses -= 1
        self.guessed_chars.add(char)
        self.get_status()

    def get_masked_word(self):
        return ''.join([char if char in self.guessed_chars else '_' for char in self.word])

    def get_status(self):
        if set(self.word) <= self.guessed_chars:
            self.status = STATUS_WIN
        elif self.remaining_guesses < 0:
            self.status = STATUS_LOSE
        else:
            self.status = STATUS_ONGOING
        return self.status
```
