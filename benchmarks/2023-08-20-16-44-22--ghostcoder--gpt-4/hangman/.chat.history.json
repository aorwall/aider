Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.\n\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.\nraise ValueError(\"The game has already ended.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

If the game is not ongoing, a ValueError is raised. If the character is not in the word or has already been guessed, the remaining guesses are reduced by 1. The guessed character is then added to `guessed_chars`.\n\nIn the `get_masked_word` method, I have added the logic to return the word with all unguessed characters replaced by '_'.\n\nIn the `get_status` method, I have added the logic to return the status of the game.
