To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the range of numbers from `min_factor` to `max_factor` (both inclusive) and calculate the product of each pair of numbers. We then check if the product is a palindrome and if it is, we store it along with its factors. For the `largest` function, we keep track of the largest palindrome and its factors, and for the `smallest` function, we keep track of the smallest palindrome and its factors.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: palindrome_products.py
```python
def largest(min_factor, max_factor):
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    max_palindrome = 0
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and product >= max_palindrome:
                if product > max_palindrome:
                    max_palindrome = product
                    factors = [(i, j)]
                elif product == max_palindrome:
                    factors.append((i, j))

    return max_palindrome, factors


def smallest(min_factor, max_factor):
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    min_palindrome = float('inf')
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and product <= min_palindrome:
                if product < min_palindrome:
                    min_palindrome = product
                    factors = [(i, j)]
                elif product == min_palindrome:
                    factors.append((i, j))

    return min_palindrome, factors
```

In the `largest` function, we initialize `max_palindrome` to 0 and `factors` to an empty list. We then iterate over the range of numbers from `min_factor` to `max_factor` (both inclusive) and calculate the product of each pair of numbers. If the product is a palindrome and it's greater than or equal to `max_palindrome`, we update `max_palindrome` and `factors`. If the product is equal to `max_palindrome`, we append the pair of factors to `factors`.

In the `smallest` function, we do the same thing but we initialize `min_palindrome` to infinity and we update `min_palindrome` and `factors` if the product is a palindrome and it's less than or equal to `min_palindrome`.

The check for palindrome is done by converting the product to a string and comparing it with its reverse. If they are equal, the product is a palindrome.

The functions return a tuple of the largest or smallest palindrome and its factors. If the `min_factor` is greater than the `max_factor`, a `ValueError` is raised.
