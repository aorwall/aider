To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that generates prime numbers until it reaches the nth prime number. 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

We can use a helper function, `is_prime()`, to check if a number is prime. This function will iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (since a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked), and return False if any of these divides the number without a remainder.

In the `prime()` function, we'll start from the first prime number (2) and keep checking subsequent numbers to see if they're prime, until we've found the required number of prime numbers.

We also need to add a check at the start of the `prime()` function to raise a `ValueError` if the input is less than 1, as there is no zeroth or negative prime number.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: nth_prime.py
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime(number):
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < number:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num
```
In this code, `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime, and `prime()` uses this to find the nth prime number. The `while` loop in `prime()` continues until we've found the required number of prime numbers.
