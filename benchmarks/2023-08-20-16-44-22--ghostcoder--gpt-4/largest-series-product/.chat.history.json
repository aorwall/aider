        "text": "# Introduction\n\nYou work for a government agency that has intercepted a series of encrypted communication signals from a group of bank robbers.\nThe signals contain a long sequence of digits.\nYour team needs to use various digital signal processing techniques to analyze the signals and identify any patterns that may indicate the planning of a heist.\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to look for patterns in the long sequence of digits in the encrypted signal.\n\nThe technique you're going to use here is called the largest series product.\n\nLet's define a few terms, first.\n\n- **input**: the sequence of digits that you need to analyze\n- **series**: a sequence of adjacent digits (those that are next to each other) that is contained within the input\n- **span**: how many digits long each series is\n- **product**: what you get when you multiply numbers together\n\nLet's work through an example, with the input `\"63915\"`.\n\n- To form a series, take adjacent digits in the original input.\n- If you are working with a span of `3`, there will be three possible series:\n  - `\"639\"`\n  - `\"391\"`\n  - `\"915\"`\n- Then we need to calculate the product of each series:\n  - The product of the series `\"639\"` is 162 (`6 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9 = 162`)\n  - The product of the series `\"391\"` is 27 (`3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 = 27`)\n  - The product of the series `\"915\"` is 45 (`9 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 = 45`)\n- 162 is bigger than both 27 and 45, so the largest series product of `\"63915\"` is from the series `\"639\"`.\n  So the answer is **162**.\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when your `largest_product()` function receives invalid input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  Feel free to reuse your code from the `series` exercise!\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# span of numbers is longer than number series\nraise ValueError(\"span must be smaller than string length\")\n\n# span of number is negative\nraise ValueError(\"span must not be negative\")\n\n# series includes non-number input\nraise ValueError(\"digits input must only contain digits\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: largest_series_product.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
