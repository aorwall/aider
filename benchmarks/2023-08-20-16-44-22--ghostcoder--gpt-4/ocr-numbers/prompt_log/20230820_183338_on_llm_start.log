Human: # Instructions

Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is represented, or whether it is garbled.

## Step One

To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.

The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns wide.

```text
     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank
```

Is converted to "0"

```text
         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)
```

Is converted to "1"

If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should return '?'

If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.

## Step Two

Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing garbled numbers with ?

## Step Three

Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string.

```text
 _
 _|
|_

```

Is converted to "2"

```text
      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank
```

Is converted to "1234567890"

## Step Four

Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line.
When converting several lines, join the lines with commas.

```text
    _  _
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|

    _  _
|_||_ |_
  | _||_|

 _  _  _
  ||_||_|
  ||_| _|

```

Is converted to "123,456,789".

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `convert()` function receives a string that isn't a valid OCR number. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the rows aren't multiples of 4
raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")

# when the columns aren't multiples of 3
raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: ocr_numbers.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: To solve this problem, we need to create a dictionary that maps each 3x4 grid representation of a number to its corresponding digit. Then, we can iterate over the input grid in chunks of 3 columns and 4 rows, converting each chunk to a digit using our dictionary. If a chunk doesn't match any digit, we replace it with a '?'. We also need to handle the case where the input grid is not a valid size by raising a ValueError.

Here's how we can implement this:
I updated a file.
Filepath: ocr_numbers.py
```python
def convert(input_grid):
    # Define the 3x4 grid representation of each digit
    digits = {
        " _

        "

   ": "9",
    }

    # Check if the input grid is a valid size
    if len(input_grid) % 4 != 0 or any(len(row) % 3 != 0 for row in input_grid):
        raise ValueError("Input grid is not a valid size")

    # Split the input grid into lines
    lines = [input_grid[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(input_grid), 4)]

    # Convert each line to a number
    numbers = []
    for line in lines:
        number = ""
        for i in range(0, len(line[0]), 3):
            chunk = "
".join(row[i:i+3] for row in line)
            number += digits.get(chunk, "?")
        numbers.append(number)

    return ",".join(numbers)
```
