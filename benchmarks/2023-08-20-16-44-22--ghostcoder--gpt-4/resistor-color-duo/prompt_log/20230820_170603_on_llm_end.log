Sure, I can help with that. 

The task is to create a function that takes a list of colors as input and returns a two-digit number based on the color codes. If more than two colors are provided, we should ignore the extra colors.

To achieve this, we can create a dictionary where the keys are the color names and the values are the corresponding numbers. Then, we can use list comprehension to map the input colors to their corresponding numbers, join them into a string, and convert the string to an integer.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: resistor_color_duo.py
```python
def value(colors):
    color_codes = {
        'black': 0,
        'brown': 1,
        'red': 2,
        'orange': 3,
        'yellow': 4,
        'green': 5,
        'blue': 6,
        'violet': 7,
        'grey': 8,
        'white': 9
    }
    return int(''.join(str(color_codes[color]) for color in colors[:2]))
```

In this code, `colors[:2]` ensures that we only consider the first two colors. If less than two colors are provided, it will still work correctly. If a color that is not in the dictionary is provided, it will raise a KeyError.
