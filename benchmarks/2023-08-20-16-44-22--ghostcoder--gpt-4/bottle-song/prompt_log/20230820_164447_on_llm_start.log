Human: # Instructions

Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.

Note that not all verses are identical.

```text
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.

Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.

Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.

Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.

Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.

Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.

Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.

Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.

Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.

One green bottle hanging on the wall,
One green bottle hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: bottle_song.py
AI: The function `recite` needs to generate the lyrics of the song "Ten Green Bottles". The parameters `start` and `take` represent the starting number of bottles and the number of bottles that fall in each verse, respectively.

To implement this, we can use a loop that starts from the `start` parameter and decreases by `take` in each iteration. For each iteration, we generate the four lines of the verse using string formatting to insert the current number of bottles and the number of bottles after `take` bottles have fallen.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, 0, -take):
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"And if {take} green bottle{'s' if take > 1 else ''} should accidentally fall,")
        lyrics.append(f"There'll be {i-take} green bottle{'s' if i-take > 1 else ' no' if i-take == 0 else ''} hanging on the wall.")
    return lyrics
```
This function will return a list of strings, where each string is a line of the song. The `'s' if i > 1 else ''` part is used to add an 's' to the word 'bottle' when the number of bottles is more than 1. The `' no' if i-take == 0 else ''` part is used to replace the number 0 with the word 'no' in the last line of the song.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bottle_song.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, 0, -take):
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"And if {take} green bottle{'s' if take > 1 else ''} should accidentally fall,")
        lyrics.append(f"There'll be {i-take} green bottle{'s' if i-take > 1 else ' no' if i-take == 0 else ''} hanging on the wall.")
    return lyrics
