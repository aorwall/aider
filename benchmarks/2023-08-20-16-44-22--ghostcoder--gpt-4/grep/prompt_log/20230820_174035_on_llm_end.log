To implement the `grep` function, we will use the `re` module for regular expressions and the `os` module for file operations. 

The `grep` function will first process the flags to set up the search parameters. Then, it will iterate over the files, open each file, and search each line for the pattern. If a match is found, the line is added to the results. 

The flags are processed as follows:

- `-n`: If this flag is present, the line number will be prepended to each matching line.
- `-l`: If this flag is present, only the names of files with at least one match will be returned.
- `-i`: If this flag is present, the search will be case-insensitive.
- `-v`: If this flag is present, lines that do not match the pattern will be returned.
- `-x`: If this flag is present, only lines that exactly match the pattern will be returned.

Filepath: grep.py
```python
import re
import os

def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    results = []
    line_number = '-n' in flags
    file_names_only = '-l' in flags
    case_insensitive = '-i' in flags
    invert = '-v' in flags
    whole_line = '-x' in flags

    if case_insensitive:
        pattern = pattern.lower()

    for file in files:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
                search_line = line.lower() if case_insensitive else line
                match = re.fullmatch(pattern, search_line.strip()) if whole_line else re.search(pattern, search_line)
                if (match and not invert) or (not match and invert):
                    if file_names_only:
                        results.append(file)
                        break
                    prefix = f"{file}:{i}:" if line_number else f"{file}:"
                    results.append(f"{prefix}{line.strip()}")
    return results
```
