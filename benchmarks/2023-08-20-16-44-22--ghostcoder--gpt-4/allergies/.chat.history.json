For example, if the score is 34 (which is 100010 in binary), it means the person is allergic to peanuts (2nd bit from right) and chocolate (6th bit from right).\n\nIn the `__init__` method, we'll store the score after performing a bitwise AND operation with 255. This is to ignore allergens not listed above (allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.). \n\nThe `allergic_to` method will check if the person is allergic to a given item. It will do this by performing a bitwise AND operation between the score and the value of the item. If the result is not zero, it means the person is allergic to the item.\n\nThe `lst` property will return a list of all allergens the person is allergic to. It will do this by checking each bit of the score and adding the corresponding allergen to the list if the bit is set.",
