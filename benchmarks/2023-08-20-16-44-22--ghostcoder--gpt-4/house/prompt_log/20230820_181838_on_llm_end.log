prompt:
The test failures indicate that the expected output is a list of strings, not a single string. Each verse should be a separate string in the list. 

To fix this, we can modify the `recite` function to return a list of verses instead of a single string. We can do this by simply removing the `join` call and returning the slice of the `verses` list directly.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: house.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    verses = [
        'This is the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the horse and the hound and the horn\nthat belonged to the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.'
    ]
    return verses[start_verse - 1:end_verse]
```
In this updated code, the `recite` function now returns a list of verses from `start_verse` to `end_verse`, which should match the expected output format in the tests.
