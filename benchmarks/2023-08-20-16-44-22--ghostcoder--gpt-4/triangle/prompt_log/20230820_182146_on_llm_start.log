Human: # Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: triangle.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: triangle.py
AI: Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement the functions in the `triangle.py` file:
I updated a file.
Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a == b == c


def isosceles(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a == b or b == c or a == c


def scalene(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a != b and b != c and a != c
```
Here's what I did:

- For each function, I first unpack the `sides` list into three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. These represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
- I then check if any of the sides is less than or equal to 0. If so, I return `False` because a triangle cannot have a side of length 0 or less.
- For the `equilateral` function, I check if all three sides are equal. If so, I return `True`; otherwise, I return `False`.
- For the `isosceles` function, I check if at least two sides are equal. If so, I return `True`; otherwise, I return `False`.
- For the `scalene` function, I check if all three sides are different. If so, I return `True`; otherwise, I return `False`.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in triangle.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a == b == c


def isosceles(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a == b or b == c or a == c


def scalene(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    return a != b and b != c and a != c
```
