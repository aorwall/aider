```python
def convert(number):
    result = ''
    if number % 3 == 0:
        result += 'Pling'
    if number % 5 == 0:
        result += 'Plang'
    if number % 7 == 0:
        result += 'Plong'
    if result == '':
        result = str(number)
    return result
```

In the given code, I have implemented the `convert` function which takes a number as input and returns a string based on the rules provided. 

The function checks if the number is divisible by 3, 5, and 7 using the modulo operation. If the number is divisible by 3, it appends 'Pling' to the result string. If it's divisible by 5, it appends 'Plang', and if it's divisible by 7, it appends 'Plong'. 

If the number is not divisible by any of these three numbers, the function converts the number to a string and assigns it to the result. 

Finally, the function returns the result string.
