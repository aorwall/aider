Human: # Instructions

Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]

## Edge cases

- Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?
- Can you ask for negative change?
- Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in
raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: change.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: change.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a list `dp` of size `target + 1` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of coins required to make the change for the amount `i`. We initialize `dp[0]` to 0 as no coins are required to make the change for the amount 0. For the rest of the amounts, we initialize the `dp` list to `float('inf')` as we don't know the minimum number of coins yet.

Then, for each coin in the `coins` list, we update our `dp` list. For each amount `i` from the value of the coin to `target`, we set `dp[i]` to the minimum of the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. `dp[i - coin] + 1` represents the number of coins required to make the change for the amount `i` if we use the current coin.

Finally, if `dp[target]` is still `float('inf')`, it means we can't make the change for the `target` amount with the given coins, so we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we return `dp[target]` as the minimum number of coins required.
I updated a file.
Filepath: change.py
```python
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Target can't be negative")
    if target > 0 and min(coins) > target:
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    dp = [0] + [float('inf')] * target
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    return dp[target]
```
This function will return the minimum number of coins required to make the change for the `target` amount. If it's not possible to make the change with the given coins, it will raise a `ValueError`.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in change.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: change.py
```python
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Target can't be negative")
    if target > 0 and min(coins) > target:
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    dp = [0] + [float('inf')] * target
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    return dp[target]
```
