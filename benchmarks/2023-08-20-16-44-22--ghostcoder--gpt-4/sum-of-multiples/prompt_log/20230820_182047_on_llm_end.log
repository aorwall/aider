prompt:
The error messages indicate that the `range()` function is receiving a step argument of zero, which is not allowed. This happens when the `multiples` list contains a zero. 

To fix this, we can add a condition to the list comprehension to skip the iteration when the `multiple` is zero. 

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: sum_of_multiples.py
```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    # Generate the multiples of each base value that are less than the level number
    multiples_list = [i for multiple in multiples if multiple != 0 for i in range(multiple, limit, multiple)]
    # Combine these lists into a single list, convert it to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_multiples = set(multiples_list)
    # Sum the unique multiples
    return sum(unique_multiples)
```
In this updated code, the condition `if multiple != 0` is added to the list comprehension. This condition checks if the `multiple` is not zero before generating the range of multiples. If the `multiple` is zero, the iteration is skipped and no multiples are generated for that `multiple`. This prevents the `range()` function from receiving a step argument of zero and causing a `ValueError`.
