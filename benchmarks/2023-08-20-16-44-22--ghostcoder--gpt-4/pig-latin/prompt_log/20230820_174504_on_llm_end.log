To implement the Pig Latin translator, we need to follow the rules you provided. We'll use Python's built-in string and regex functions to manipulate the text. Here's how we can implement the `translate` function:

1. Split the input text into words.
2. For each word, check if it starts with a vowel sound (including "xr" and "yt"). If it does, add "ay" to the end.
3. If the word starts with a consonant sound, find the first vowel that's not part of a "qu" after a consonant, move all the letters before it to the end, and add "ay".
4. If the word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word, treat it as a vowel.
5. Join all the translated words back into a sentence.

Filepath: pig_latin.py
```python
import re

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated_words = []

    for word in words:
        if re.match(r'^(xr|yt|[aeiou])', word):
            translated_word = word + 'ay'
        else:
            match = re.search(r'^(qu|[^aeiou]*qu|[^aeiouy]+)(.*)', word)
            if match:
                translated_word = match.group(2) + match.group(1) + 'ay'
            else:
                translated_word = word + 'ay'
        translated_words.append(translated_word)

    return ' '.join(translated_words)
```
This function should work for most cases. However, it might not handle all edge cases or regional variants of Pig Latin. You might need to adjust the regular expressions or add more rules to cover those cases.
