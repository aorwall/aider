System: Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code. 

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment. 
* YOU MUST include the definitions of parent classes and functions.

* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

Human: # Instructions

Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.

So given a string with embedded newlines like:

```text
9 8 7
5 3 2
6 6 7
```

representing this matrix:

```text
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2
3 | 6  6  7
```

your code should be able to spit out:

- A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,
- A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.

The rows for our example matrix:

- 9, 8, 7
- 5, 3, 2
- 6, 6, 7

And its columns:

- 9, 5, 6
- 8, 3, 6
- 7, 2, 7
# Instructions append

In this exercise you're going to create a **class**.  _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think!_ 

-   [**A First Look at Classes**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes) from the Python 3 documentation. 
-   [**How to Define a Class in Python**](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#how-to-define-a-class-in-python) from the Real Python website.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matrix.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: matrix.py
```python
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        pass

    def row(self, index):
        pass

    def column(self, index):
        pass

```
