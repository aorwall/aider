To solve this problem, we can use the ASCII value of the letters. The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and for 'Z' is 90. We can use this information to calculate the number of rows and columns for the diamond. 

The number of rows and columns for the diamond is 2 * (ASCII value of input letter - ASCII value of 'A') + 1. 

We can then iterate over each row and column and calculate the letter to be printed at that position. If the absolute value of the difference between the row number and the column number is equal to the ASCII value of the input letter - ASCII value of 'A', we print the letter, otherwise we print a space.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    size = 2 * (ord(letter) - ord('A')) + 1
    diamond = [[' ' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    
    for row in range(size):
        for col in range(size):
            diff = abs(row - col)
            if diff == abs(ord(letter) - ord('A')):
                diamond[row][col] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[row][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[size - row - 1][col] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[size - row - 1][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
    
    return [''.join(row) for row in diamond]
```

In this code, we first calculate the size of the diamond. Then we create a 2D list of spaces of the calculated size. We then iterate over each row and column of the diamond. For each position, we calculate the difference between the row number and the column number. If this difference is equal to the ASCII value of the input letter - ASCII value of 'A', we replace the space at that position with the corresponding letter. We do this for all four quadrants of the diamond. Finally, we join each row of the diamond into a string and return the list of strings.
