I see the issue. The problem is with the calculation of the letter to be printed at each position. The letter should be determined by the distance from the center of the diamond, not the difference between the row and column numbers. 

We can calculate the distance from the center as the maximum of the absolute difference between the row number and the center of the diamond, and the absolute difference between the column number and the center of the diamond. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    size = 2 * (ord(letter) - ord('A')) + 1
    diamond = [[' ' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    center = size // 2
    
    for row in range(size):
        for col in range(size):
            dist = max(abs(center - row), abs(center - col))
            if dist <= center:
                diamond[row][col] = chr(ord('A') + center - dist)
                diamond[row][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + center - dist)
                diamond[size - row - 1][col] = chr(ord('A') + center - dist)
                diamond[size - row - 1][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + center - dist)
    
    return [''.join(row) for row in diamond]
```
In this code, we first calculate the size of the diamond and the position of the center. Then we create a 2D list of spaces of the calculated size. We then iterate over each row and column of the diamond. For each position, we calculate the distance from the center. If this distance is less than or equal to the center, we replace the space at that position with the corresponding letter. We do this for all four quadrants of the diamond. Finally, we join each row of the diamond into a string and return the list of strings.
