(i.e. 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) like so:\n\n````python\ndef factorial(number):\n  if number <= 1:  # base case\n    return 1\n\n  return number * factorial(number - 1) # recursive case\n\nprint(factorial(5)) # returns 120\n````\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Python limits the number of times recursive calls can be made (1000 by default) and does not optimize for [tail recursion][tail-recursion].\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising].\nWhen you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\nThis makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\nFor situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][built-in-errors], but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise-statement] to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `rows()` function is passed a negative number.\nThe tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the rows function is passed a negative number.\nraise ValueError(\"number of rows is negative\")\n```\n\n[built-in-errors]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes\n[raise-statement]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\n[raising]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions\n[tail-recursion]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pascals_triangle.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
