When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the square input is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when the square value is not in the acceptable range        \nraise ValueError(\"square must be between 1 and 64\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grains.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

In a geometric progression, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2.\n\nFor the `square` function, we can calculate the number of grains on a given square by raising 2 to the power of (number - 1). We subtract 1 because the first square should have 1 grain, which is 2 to the power of 0.\n\nFor the `total` function, we can calculate the total number of grains on the chessboard by summing the geometric progression. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a is 1, r is 2, and n is 64.\n\nHere is the updated code:",
