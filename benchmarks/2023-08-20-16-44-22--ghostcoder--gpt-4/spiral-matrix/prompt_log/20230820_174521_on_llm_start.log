Human: # Instructions

Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.

The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1 in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order, like these examples:

## Examples

### Spiral matrix of size 3

```text
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

### Spiral matrix of size 4

```text
 1  2  3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10  9  8 7
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: spiral_matrix.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: spiral_matrix.py
```python
def spiral_matrix(size):
    pass

```
