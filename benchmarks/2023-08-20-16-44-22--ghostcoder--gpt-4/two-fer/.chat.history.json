If `name` is provided, the function should return \"One for {name}, one for me.\".\n\nTo implement this, we can use a conditional statement to check if `name` is provided. If it is, we return the string with the name. If it's not, we return the string with \"you\". \n\nWe can use Python's f-string formatting to insert the name into the string. F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.\n\nHere is the updated code:",
