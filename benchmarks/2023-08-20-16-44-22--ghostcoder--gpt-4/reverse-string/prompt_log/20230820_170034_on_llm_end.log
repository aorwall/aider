To reverse a string in Python, you can use slicing. The syntax for slicing is `start:stop:step`. If you don't specify the start, it defaults to 0. If you don't specify the stop, it defaults to the end of the string. If you don't specify the step, it defaults to 1. 

To reverse a string, you can start at the end of the string (which is specified by not providing a start), stop at the beginning of the string (which is specified by not providing a stop), and step backwards through the string (which is specified by a step of -1).

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: reverse_string.py
```python
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]
```
