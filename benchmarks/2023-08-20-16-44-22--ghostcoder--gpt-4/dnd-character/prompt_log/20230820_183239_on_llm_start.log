Human: # Instructions

For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.
These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.
You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.
You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.
You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:

- 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
- 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
- 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
- 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
- 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
- 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.

Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

## Notes

Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.
One such language is [Troll][troll].

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: dnd_character.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: dnd_character.py
AI: Sure, I will implement the `Character` class with the following methods:

- `__init__`: This method will initialize the character with six abilities and initial hitpoints.
- `ability`: This method will simulate the rolling of four 6-sided dice and return the sum of the largest three dice.
- `modifier`: This method will calculate the constitution modifier.
I updated a file.
Filepath: dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.ability()
        self.dexterity = self.ability()
        self.constitution = self.ability()
        self.intelligence = self.ability()
        self.wisdom = self.ability()
        self.charisma = self.ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.modifier(self.constitution)

    def ability(self):
        return sum(sorted(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4))[1:])

    @staticmethod
    def modifier(constitution):
        return (constitution - 10) // 2
```
In the `__init__` method, I'm assigning the result of the `ability` method to each of the six abilities. The `ability` method simulates the rolling of four 6-sided dice, sorts the results, discards the smallest one (by slicing the list starting from index 1), and returns the sum of the remaining three. The `modifier` method calculates the constitution modifier as per the given formula. The hitpoints are then calculated using the constitution modifier and added to the initial 10 hitpoints.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in dnd_character.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.ability()
        self.dexterity = self.ability()
        self.constitution = self.ability()
        self.intelligence = self.ability()
        self.wisdom = self.ability()
        self.charisma = self.ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.modifier(self.constitution)

    def ability(self):
        return sum(sorted(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4))[1:])

    @staticmethod
    def modifier(constitution):
