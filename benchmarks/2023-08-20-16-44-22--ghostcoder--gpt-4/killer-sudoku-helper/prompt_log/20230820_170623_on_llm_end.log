To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function to generate all possible combinations of digits that add up to the target sum. We start by iterating over all digits from 1 to 9, and for each digit, we recursively find all combinations of the remaining digits that add up to the target sum minus the current digit. We also need to make sure that we do not include any digits that are in the exclude list.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    # Base cases
    if size == 0:
        return [[]] if target == 0 else []
    if size < 0 or target <= 0:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(1, 10):
        if i not in exclude:
            # Recursively find combinations that add up to target - i
            for combo in combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude + [i]):
                result.append([i] + combo)

    return sorted(result)
```

In this code, the function `combinations` takes three parameters: `target` (the sum that the digits in the cage should add up to), `size` (the number of digits in the cage), and `exclude` (a list of digits that cannot be used). The function returns a list of all valid combinations of digits that add up to the target sum, sorted in ascending order.

The base cases handle the situations where the size is zero (in which case we return an empty list if the target is also zero, or an empty list otherwise), and where the size is negative or the target is zero or negative (in which case we return an empty list).

The main part of the function iterates over all digits from 1 to 9, and for each digit that is not in the exclude list, it recursively finds all combinations of the remaining digits that add up to the target sum minus the current digit. Each valid combination is then added to the result list.

Finally, the function returns the result list, sorted in ascending order.
