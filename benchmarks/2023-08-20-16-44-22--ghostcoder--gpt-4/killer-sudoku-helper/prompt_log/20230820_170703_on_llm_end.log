The test failures are due to the fact that the function is returning all permutations of the valid combinations, not just the combinations themselves. This is because the function is appending the current digit to the front of each combination, which results in different orderings of the same combination being treated as distinct.

To fix this, we can sort each combination before appending it to the result list, and then remove duplicates from the result list before returning it. This will ensure that each combination is always in the same order, and that each combination only appears once in the result list.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    # Base cases
    if size == 0:
        return [[]] if target == 0 else []
    if size < 0 or target <= 0:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(1, 10):
        if i not in exclude:
            # Recursively find combinations that add up to target - i
            for combo in combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude + [i]):
                # Sort each combination before appending it to the result list
                result.append(sorted([i] + combo))

    # Remove duplicates from the result list before returning it
    return sorted(list(set(tuple(comb) for comb in result)))
```
In this updated code, each combination is sorted before it is appended to the result list. This ensures that each combination is always in the same order, regardless of the order in which the digits were originally generated.

Then, before returning the result list, we convert each combination to a tuple (since lists cannot be elements of a set), and then convert the list of tuples to a set to remove duplicates. Finally, we convert the set back to a list and sort it before returning it. This ensures that each combination only appears once in the result list, and that the combinations are returned in ascending order.
