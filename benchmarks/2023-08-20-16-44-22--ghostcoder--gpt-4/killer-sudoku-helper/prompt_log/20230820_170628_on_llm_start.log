Human: # Instructions

A friend of yours is learning how to solve Killer Sudokus (rules below) but struggling to figure out which digits can go in a cage.
They ask you to help them out by writing a small program that lists all valid combinations for a given cage, and any constraints that affect the cage.

To make the output of your program easy to read, the combinations it returns must be sorted.

## Killer Sudoku Rules

- [Standard Sudoku rules][sudoku-rules] apply.
- The digits in a cage, usually marked by a dotted line, add up to the small number given in the corner of the cage.
- A digit may only occur once in a cage.

For a more detailed explanation, check out [this guide][killer-guide].

## Example 1: Cage with only 1 possible combination

In a 3-digit cage with a sum of 7, there is only one valid combination: 124.

- 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- Any other combination that adds up to 7, e.g. 232, would violate the rule of not repeating digits within a cage.

![Sudoku grid, with three killer cages that are marked as grouped together. The first killer cage is in the 3×3 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3×3 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3×3 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]

## Example 2: Cage with several combinations

In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:

- 19
- 28
- 37
- 46

![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]

## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted

In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:

- 28
- 37

19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.

![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: killer_sudoku_helper.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function to generate all possible combinations of digits that add up to the target sum. We start by iterating over all digits from 1 to 9, and for each digit, we recursively find all combinations of the remaining digits that add up to the target sum minus the current digit. We also need to make sure that we do not include any digits that are in the exclude list.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    # Base cases
    if size == 0:
        return [[]] if target == 0 else []
    if size < 0 or target <= 0:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(1, 10):
        if i not in exclude:
            # Recursively find combinations that add up to target - i
            for combo in combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude + [i]):
                result.append([i] + combo)

    return sorted(result)
```
In this code, the function `combinations` takes three parameters: `target` (the sum that the digits in the cage should add up to), `size` (the number of digits in the cage), and `exclude` (a list of digits that cannot be used). The function returns a list of all valid combinations of digits that add up to the target sum, sorted in ascending order.

The base cases handle the situations where the size is zero (in which case we return an empty list if the target is also zero, or an empty list otherwise), and where the size is negative or the target is zero or negative (in which case we return an empty list).

The main part of the function iterates over all digits from 1 to 9, and for each digit that is not in the exclude list, it recursively finds all combinations of the remaining digits that add up to the target sum minus the current digit. Each valid combination is then added to the result list.

Finally, the function returns the result list, sorted in ascending order.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in killer_sudoku_helper.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    # Base cases
    if size == 0:
        return [[]] if target == 0 else []
    if size < 0 or target <= 0:

            for combo in combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude + [i]):
                result.append([i] + combo)

    return sorted(result)
