To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that counts the number of rectangles in the ASCII diagram. The algorithm works by iterating over each point in the diagram and checking if it's the top-left corner of a rectangle. If it is, we increment a counter. 

Here's how we can check if a point is the top-left corner of a rectangle:

1. Check if the current point is a '+'.
2. If it is, iterate to the right until we find another '+'.
3. Then, iterate downwards until we find another '+'.
4. If we find a '+', check if there's a rectangle by going right from the lower '+' and up from the right '+'.
5. If both paths end in a '+', we've found a rectangle.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: rectangles.py
```python
def rectangles(strings):
    height = len(strings)
    width = len(strings[0]) if height else 0
    count = 0

    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if strings[i][j] == '+':
                for k in range(j + 1, width):
                    if strings[i][k] == '+':
                        for l in range(i + 1, height):
                            if strings[l][j] == '+' and strings[l][k] == '+':
                                count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over each point in the ASCII diagram (nested for loops for i and j). If it finds a '+' (indicating a potential top-left corner of a rectangle), it then checks to the right (for loop for k) and downwards (for loop for l) for other '+' characters. If it finds them, it increments the count of rectangles. The function finally returns the count.
