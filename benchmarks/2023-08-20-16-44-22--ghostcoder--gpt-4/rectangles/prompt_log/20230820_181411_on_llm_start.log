Human: # Instructions

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains these 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text


   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text


+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text

  ++
  ++


```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of every line equals the length of the first line).

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rectangles.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: rectangles.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that counts the number of rectangles in the ASCII diagram. The algorithm works by iterating over each point in the diagram and checking if it's the top-left corner of a rectangle. If it is, we increment a counter. 

Here's how we can check if a point is the top-left corner of a rectangle:

1. Check if the current point is a '+'.
2. If it is, iterate to the right until we find another '+'.
3. Then, iterate downwards until we find another '+'.
4. If we find a '+', check if there's a rectangle by going right from the lower '+' and up from the right '+'.
5. If both paths end in a '+', we've found a rectangle.

Here's the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: rectangles.py
```python
def rectangles(strings):
    height = len(strings)
    width = len(strings[0]) if height else 0
    count = 0

    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if strings[i][j] == '+':
                for k in range(j + 1, width):
                    if strings[i][k] == '+':
                        for l in range(i + 1, height):
                            if strings[l][j] == '+' and strings[l][k] == '+':
                                count += 1
    return count
```
This function works by iterating over each point in the ASCII diagram (nested for loops for i and j). If it finds a '+' (indicating a potential top-left corner of a rectangle), it then checks to the right (for loop for k) and downwards (for loop for l) for other '+' characters. If it finds them, it increments the count of rectangles. The function finally returns the count.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in rectangles.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: rectangles.py
```python
def rectangles(strings):
    height = len(strings)
    width = len(strings[0]) if height else 0
    count = 0

    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if strings[i][j] == '+':
                for k in range(j + 1, width):
                    if strings[i][k] == '+':
                        for l in range(i + 1, height):
                            if strings[l][j] == '+' and strings[l][k] == '+':
                                count += 1
    return count
```
