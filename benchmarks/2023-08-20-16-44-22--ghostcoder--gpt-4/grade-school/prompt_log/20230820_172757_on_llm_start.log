Human: # Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think.
    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.
    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: grade_school.py
AI: Based on the instructions, we need to implement a School class that can add students to a grade, get a list of all students in a grade, and get a sorted list of all students in all grades. 

Here's how we can implement this:
I updated a file.
Filepath: grade_school.py
```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade not in self.students:
            self.students[grade] = []
        if name not in self.students[grade]:
            self.students[grade].append(name)
            self.students[grade].sort()
        else:
            return "Student already added."

    def roster(self):
        roster = []
        for grade in sorted(self.students.keys()):
            for student in self.students[grade]:
                roster.append(student)
        return roster

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.students:
            return self.students[grade_number]
        else:
            return []
```
In the `__init__` method, we initialize an empty dictionary to store the students. The keys of this dictionary will be the grade numbers, and the values will be lists of student names.

In the `add_student` method, we first check if the grade exists in the dictionary. If it doesn't, we add it and initialize an empty list for the students. Then we check if the student is already in the list for that grade. If they are not, we add them and sort the list. If they are, we return a message indicating that the student has already been added.

In the `roster` method, we create an empty list for the roster. We then iterate over the grades in the dictionary in sorted order, and for each grade, we iterate over the students and add them to the roster. Finally, we return the roster.

In the `grade` method, we check if the grade exists in the dictionary. If it does, we return the list of students for that grade. If it doesn't, we return an empty list.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grade_school.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: grade_school.py
```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade not in self.students:
            self.students[grade] = []
        if name not in self.students[grade]:
            self.students[grade].append(name)
            self.students[grade].sort()
        else:
            return "Student already added."

    def roster(self):
        roster = []
        for grade in sorted(self.students.keys()):
            for student in self.students[grade]:
                roster.append(student)
        return roster

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.students:
            return self.students[grade_number]
        else:
            return []
```
