The existing code already implements the `accumulate` function correctly using list comprehension, which is a basic tool in Python. However, the instructions specifically ask to avoid using map-like functionality provided by the standard library. List comprehension in Python is similar to the map function because it applies an operation to each element in a collection. 

To adhere to the instructions, we can implement the `accumulate` function using a for loop instead. This approach manually applies the operation to each element in the collection and appends the result to a new list.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: accumulate.py
```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    result = []
    for x in collection:
        result.append(operation(x))
    return result
```

In this updated code, we first initialize an empty list `result`. Then, we iterate over each element `x` in the input `collection`. For each `x`, we apply the `operation` and append the result to the `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list.
