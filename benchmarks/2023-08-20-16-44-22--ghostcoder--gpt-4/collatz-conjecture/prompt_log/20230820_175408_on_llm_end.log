To solve this problem, we will use a while loop to repeatedly apply the operations defined by the Collatz Conjecture until we reach 1. We will also keep a count of the number of steps taken, which we will increment each time we apply an operation.

Before we start the loop, we will check if the input number is less than or equal to 0. If it is, we will raise a ValueError with a meaningful message, as instructed.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: collatz_conjecture.py
```python
def steps(number):
    if number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")

    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number = number // 2
        else:
            number = 3 * number + 1
        count += 1

    return count
```

In this code, the while loop continues as long as the number is not 1. Inside the loop, we check if the number is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (`number % 2 == 0`). If it is, we divide the number by 2 using integer division (`number // 2`). If it's not, we multiply the number by 3 and add 1 (`3 * number + 1`). After each operation, we increment the count by 1 (`count += 1`). When the number finally becomes 1, the loop ends and we return the count, which represents the number of steps taken.
