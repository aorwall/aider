To solve this problem, we need to map each binary digit to its corresponding action. We can do this by creating a list of actions and using the index of each action in the list to represent its binary value. 

We start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, adding the corresponding action to the result list for each '1' we encounter. If we encounter a '1' at the index that represents the 'reverse' action (index 4), we reverse the order of the actions in the result list.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: secret_handshake.py
```python
def commands(binary_str):
    actions = ['wink', 'double blink', 'close your eyes', 'jump']
    result = [actions[i] for i in range(4) if binary_str.zfill(5)[::-1][i] == '1']
    if binary_str.zfill(5)[::-1][4] == '1':
        result.reverse()
    return result
```

In this code, `zfill(5)` is used to pad the binary string with leading zeros to ensure it has 5 digits. `[::-1]` is used to reverse the string so that we can start from the rightmost digit. The list comprehension `[actions[i] for i in range(4) if binary_str.zfill(5)[::-1][i] == '1']` generates the list of actions corresponding to '1's in the binary string. If the leftmost digit is '1', the order of the actions is reversed.
