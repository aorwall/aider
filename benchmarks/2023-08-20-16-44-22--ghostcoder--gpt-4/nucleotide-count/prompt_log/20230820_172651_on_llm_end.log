To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in `count()` function which counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a given string. We will use this function to count the occurrences of each nucleotide in the DNA sequence.

For the `count(strand, nucleotide)` function, we first check if the nucleotide is valid (i.e., it is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'). If it is not, we raise a `ValueError`. If it is valid, we return the count of the nucleotide in the strand.

For the `nucleotide_counts(strand)` function, we create a dictionary with the nucleotides as keys and their counts as values. We then return this dictionary.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: nucleotide_count.py
```python
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if nucleotide not in 'ACGT':
        raise ValueError("Invalid Nucleotide")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    return {'A': count(strand, 'A'), 'C': count(strand, 'C'), 'G': count(strand, 'G'), 'T': count(strand, 'T')}
```

In the `count()` function, we first check if the nucleotide is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If it is not, we raise a `ValueError`. If it is, we use the `count()` function to count the number of occurrences of the nucleotide in the strand.

In the `nucleotide_counts()` function, we create a dictionary with the nucleotides as keys and their counts as values. We use the `count()` function to get the counts. We then return this dictionary.
