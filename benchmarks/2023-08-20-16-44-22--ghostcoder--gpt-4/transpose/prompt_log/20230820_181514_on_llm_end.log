I see the issue. The function is expecting a string input with lines separated by "\n", but the current implementation is treating the input as a list of lines. We need to split the input string into lines before transposing, and then join the transposed lines back into a string with "\n" separators.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: transpose.py
```python
from itertools import zip_longest

def transpose(input_text):
    lines = input_text.split('\n')
    transposed_lines = [''.join(line) for line in zip_longest(*lines, fillvalue=' ')]
    return '\n'.join(transposed_lines)
```

In this updated code, the input_text is first split into lines using the split function. After transposing the lines, the join function is used to combine the transposed lines back into a single string, with lines separated by "\n". This should match the expected output format.
