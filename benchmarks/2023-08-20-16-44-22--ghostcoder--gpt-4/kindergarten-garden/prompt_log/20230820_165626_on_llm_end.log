To solve this problem, we need to map each student to their corresponding plants. We can do this by splitting the diagram into rows and then assigning each pair of plants to a student. 

Here's how we can implement this:

Filepath: kindergarten_garden.py
```python
class Garden:
    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        self.diagram = diagram.split('\n')
        self.students = sorted(students) if students else [
            'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David',
            'Eve', 'Fred', 'Ginny', 'Harriet',
            'Ileana', 'Joseph', 'Kincaid', 'Larry'
        ]
        self.plants_dict = {'G': 'Grass', 'C': 'Clover', 'R': 'Radishes', 'V': 'Violets'}

    def plants(self, student):
        index = self.students.index(student) * 2
        plants_code = [row[index:index+2] for row in self.diagram]
        return [self.plants_dict[code] for code in ''.join(plants_code)]
```

In the `__init__` method, we split the diagram into rows and store it. We also store the students after sorting them. If no students are provided, we use the default list. We also create a dictionary to map the plant codes to their names.

In the `plants` method, we find the index of the student in the list and multiply it by 2 to get the starting index of the plants for that student in the diagram. We then get the plants for that student from each row in the diagram and use the dictionary to convert the plant codes to their names. We return the list of plant names.
