To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the books in the basket considering the maximum possible discount. We can achieve this by grouping the books in such a way that we get the maximum discount. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: book_store.py
```python
def total(basket):
    discounts = [0, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25]
    total = 0
    while len(basket) > 0:
        unique_books = set(basket)
        discount = discounts[len(unique_books)]
        total += len(unique_books) * 8 * (1 - discount)
        for book in unique_books:
            basket.remove(book)
    return total
```

In the above code, we first define the discounts for different numbers of unique books. Then we calculate the total cost of the books in the basket. We do this by finding the unique books in the basket and applying the corresponding discount. We then remove these books from the basket and repeat the process until the basket is empty. The total cost is then returned. 

This approach ensures that we always get the maximum possible discount because we always try to buy as many unique books as possible.
