Human: # Instructions

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.
Watch out for concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways.
Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc.
Shops can charge against the account.

Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language).

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  


```python
# account is not open
raise ValueError('account not open')

# account is already open
raise ValueError('account already open')

# incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount
raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')

# withdrawal is too big
raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: To implement the BankAccount class, we need to add some attributes to the class and implement the methods. 

We'll add two attributes: `open` and `balance`. The `open` attribute will be a boolean indicating whether the account is open or not. The `balance` attribute will store the current balance of the account.

In the `__init__` method, we'll initialize `open` to False and `balance` to 0.

The `get_balance` method will check if the account is open and if it is, it will return the balance. If the account is not open, it will raise a ValueError.

The `open` method will check if the account is already open and if it is, it will raise a ValueError. If the account is not open, it will set `open` to True.

The `deposit` method will check if the account is open and if the amount to deposit is greater than 0. If the account is not open or the amount is not greater than 0, it will raise a ValueError. If the account is open and the amount is greater than 0, it will add the amount to the balance.

The `withdraw` method will check if the account is open, if the amount to withdraw is greater than 0, and if the amount to withdraw is less than or equal to the balance. If any of these conditions are not met, it will raise a ValueError. If all conditions are met, it will subtract the amount from the balance.

The `close` method will check if the account is open and if it is, it will set `open` to False and `balance` to 0. If the account is not open, it will raise a ValueError.
I updated a file.
Filepath: bank_account.py
```python
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def open(self):
        if self.open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0')
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0 or amount must be less than balance')
            self.balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
```
The `lock` attribute is a threading.Lock object that is used to ensure that only one thread can execute the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods at a time. This prevents race conditions where two threads try to update the balance at the same time.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bank_account.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bank_account.py
```python
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def open(self):
        if self.open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0')
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0 or amount must be less than balance')
            self.balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
