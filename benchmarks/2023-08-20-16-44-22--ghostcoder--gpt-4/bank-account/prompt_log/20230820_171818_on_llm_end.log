The issue here is that the `open` attribute of the `BankAccount` class is a boolean, but it's also the name of a method in the same class. This is causing a `TypeError` when the tests try to call `account.open()`, because `account.open` is a boolean, not a callable method.

To fix this, we need to rename either the `open` attribute or the `open` method to avoid the name clash. I'll rename the `open` attribute to `is_open` to clearly indicate that it's a boolean.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: bank_account.py
```python
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_open = False
        self.balance = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def open(self):
        if self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.is_open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.is_open or amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0')
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.is_open or amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0 or amount must be less than balance')
            self.balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.is_open = False
        self.balance = 0
```
This should resolve the `TypeError` issues you were seeing in the tests.
