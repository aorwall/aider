```python
def square_of_sum(number):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        sum += i
    return sum ** 2


def sum_of_squares(number):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        sum += i ** 2
    return sum


def difference_of_squares(number):
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number)
```

In the `square_of_sum` function, I've implemented a loop that sums all numbers from 1 to the given number, and then squares the result.

In the `sum_of_squares` function, I've implemented a loop that squares each number from 1 to the given number, and then sums all the squared numbers.

In the `difference_of_squares` function, I've simply subtracted the result of `sum_of_squares` from the result of `square_of_sum`.
