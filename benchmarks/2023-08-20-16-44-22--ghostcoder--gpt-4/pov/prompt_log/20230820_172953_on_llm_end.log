The error messages indicate that there is a recursion error in the `_path_to` method and a problem with the `__dict__` method. The recursion error is likely due to the fact that the `_path_to` method is not correctly terminating when it should. The problem with the `__dict__` method is likely due to the fact that it is trying to convert a tree to a dictionary, but the tree is not correctly formed.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the `_path_to` and `_from_path` methods. In the `_path_to` method, we should return `None` if the current node's label does not match the given label and none of the children have a path to the given label. In the `_from_path` method, we should not add the parent node to the children if the current node is not in the children of the root.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: pov.py
```python
from json import dumps


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, children=None):
        self.label = label
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __dict__(self):
        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}

    def __str__(self, indent=None):
        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.label < other.label

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()

    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        path = self._path_to(from_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")
        return self._from_path(path)

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        tree = self.from_pov(from_node)
        path = tree._path_to(to_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("No path found")
        return [node.label for node in path]

    def _path_to(self, label, path=None):
        if path is None:
            path = []
        if self.label == label:
            return path + [self]
        for child in self.children:
            result = child._path_to(label, path + [self])
            if result:
                return result
        return None

    def _from_path(self, path):
        if not path:
            return None
        node = path[-1]
        if node in self.children:
            self.children.remove(node)
            if path[:-1]:
                self.children.append(self._from_path(path[:-1]))
        return Tree(node.label, self.children)
```
In the `_path_to` method, we return `None` if the current node's label does not match the given label and none of the children have a path to the given label.

In the `_from_path` method, we only add the parent node to the children if the current node is in the children of the root. This ensures that the tree is correctly formed and can be converted to a dictionary by the `__dict__` method.
