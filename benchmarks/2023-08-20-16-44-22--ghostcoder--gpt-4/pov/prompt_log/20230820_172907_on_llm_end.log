To solve this problem, we need to implement two methods in the Tree class: `from_pov` and `path_to`.

The `from_pov` method should reorient the tree from the perspective of the given node. This can be done by first finding the path from the root to the given node, and then rebuilding the tree from the perspective of the given node.

The `path_to` method should return the path from one node to another. This can be done by first reorienting the tree from the perspective of the start node, and then finding the path from the start node to the end node.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: pov.py
```python
from json import dumps


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, children=None):
        self.label = label
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __dict__(self):
        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}

    def __str__(self, indent=None):
        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.label < other.label

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()

    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        path = self._path_to(from_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")
        return self._from_path(path)

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        tree = self.from_pov(from_node)
        path = tree._path_to(to_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("No path found")
        return [node.label for node in path]

    def _path_to(self, label, path=None):
        if path is None:
            path = []
        if self.label == label:
            return path + [self]
        for child in self.children:
            result = child._path_to(label, path + [self])
            if result:
                return result
        return None

    def _from_path(self, path):
        if not path:
            return None
        node = path[-1]
        if node in self.children:
            self.children.remove(node)
        if path[:-1]:
            self.children.append(self._from_path(path[:-1]))
        return Tree(node.label, self.children)
```

In the `_path_to` method, we recursively search for the path from the root to the given node. If the current node's label matches the given label, we return the path to the current node. Otherwise, we search in the children of the current node.

In the `_from_path` method, we recursively rebuild the tree from the given path. If the current node is in the children of the root, we remove it from the children and add the parent node to the children. Then we return a new tree with the current node as the root and the updated children.

In the `from_pov` method, we first find the path from the root to the given node, and then rebuild the tree from the path.

In the `path_to` method, we first reorient the tree from the perspective of the start node, and then find the path from the start node to the end node.
