        "text": "# Instructions\n\nRecurring monthly meetups are generally scheduled on the given weekday of a given week each month.\nIn this exercise you will be given the recurring schedule, along with a month and year, and then asked to find the exact date of the meetup.\n\nFor example a meetup might be scheduled on the _first Monday_ of every month.\nYou might then be asked to find the date that this meetup will happen in January 2018.\nIn other words, you need to determine the date of the first Monday of January 2018.\n\nSimilarly, you might be asked to find:\n\n- the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)\n- the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)\n- the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)\n- the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)\n\nThe descriptors you are expected to process are: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.\n\nNote that descriptor `teenth` is a made-up word.\n\nIt refers to the seven numbers that end in '-teen' in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.\nBut general descriptions of dates use ordinal numbers, e.g. the _first_ Monday, the _third_ Tuesday.\n\nFor the numbers ending in '-teen', that becomes:\n\n- 13th (thirteenth)\n- 14th (fourteenth)\n- 15th (fifteenth)\n- 16th (sixteenth)\n- 17th (seventeenth)\n- 18th (eighteenth)\n- 19th (nineteenth)\n\nSo there are seven numbers ending in '-teen'.\nAnd there are also seven weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).\nTherefore, it is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one numbered day ending with \"teen\" each month.\n\nIf asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953 (or, alternately the \"Saturteenth\" of August, 1953), we need to look at the calendar for August 1953:\n\n```plaintext\n    August 1953\nSu Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa\n                   1\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n23 24 25 26 27 28 29\n30 31\n```\n\nThe Saturday that has a number ending in '-teen' is August 15, 1953.\n# Instructions append\n\n## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n\nSometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n\nCustom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n\nFor situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n\nTo customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\nclass MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n\n    message: explanation of the error.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n        \n# raising a MeetupDayException\nraise MeetupDayException(\"That day does not exist.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
