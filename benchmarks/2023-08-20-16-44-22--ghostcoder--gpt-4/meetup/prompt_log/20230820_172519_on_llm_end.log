To solve this problem, we will use the Python built-in `calendar` module. This module allows us to generate a matrix representing a month's calendar. Each row in this matrix represents a week, and each item in the row represents a day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.). 

We will create a dictionary to map the weekday names to their corresponding numbers. 

Then, we will create another dictionary to map the descriptors to their corresponding week numbers. 

In the `meetup` function, we will first check if the given `week` and `day_of_week` are valid. If not, we will raise a `MeetupDayException`. 

Then, we will generate the month's calendar and find the exact date of the meetup based on the `week` and `day_of_week`. 

If the `week` is 'teenth', we will find the day in the second and third week of the month that matches the `day_of_week`. 

If the `week` is 'last', we will find the last day in the month that matches the `day_of_week`. 

Otherwise, we will find the day in the `week`th week of the month that matches the `day_of_week`. 

If the date is not found, we will raise a `MeetupDayException`.
