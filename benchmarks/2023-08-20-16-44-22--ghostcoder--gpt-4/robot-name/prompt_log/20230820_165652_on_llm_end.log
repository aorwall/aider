To implement the Robot class as per the instructions, we need to generate a random name for the robot when it's turned on for the first time. We also need to ensure that the name is unique and doesn't collide with any existing robot names. 

To achieve this, we can use the `random` and `string` modules from Python's standard library. We'll generate a random name in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits. We'll also keep track of all the generated names in a class variable to ensure uniqueness.

When a robot is reset, we'll generate a new unique name for it.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
import random
import string

class Robot:
    _names = set()

    def __init__(self):
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        while True:
            name = self._generate_random_name()
            if name not in self._names:
                break
        self._names.discard(self.name)
        self.name = name
        self._names.add(self.name)

    @staticmethod
    def _generate_random_name():
        letters = random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase, k=2)
        digits = random.choices(string.digits, k=3)
        return ''.join(letters + digits)
```

In the above code, `_names` is a class variable that keeps track of all the generated names. In the `reset` method, we generate a new unique name and update the robot's name. The `_generate_random_name` method generates a random name in the required format.
