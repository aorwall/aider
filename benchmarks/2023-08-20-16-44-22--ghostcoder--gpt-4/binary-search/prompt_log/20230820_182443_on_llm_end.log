Sure, I can help with that. The binary search algorithm is a classic divide-and-conquer strategy for finding a specific value in a sorted list. Here's how you can implement it in Python:

Filepath: binary_search.py
```python
def find(search_list, value):
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if search_list[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        elif search_list[mid] > value:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid

    raise ValueError("value not in array")
```

In this code, we start by defining the lower and upper bounds of the search. We then enter a loop that continues as long as the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound. 

Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index of the current search range. If the value at this index is less than the value we're searching for, we know the value must be in the upper half of the current range, so we adjust the lower bound to be one more than the middle index. 

If the value at the middle index is greater than the value we're searching for, we know the value must be in the lower half of the current range, so we adjust the upper bound to be one less than the middle index. 

If the value at the middle index is equal to the value we're searching for, we've found the value and return the index. 

If the loop completes without finding the value, we raise a ValueError to indicate that the value is not in the list.
