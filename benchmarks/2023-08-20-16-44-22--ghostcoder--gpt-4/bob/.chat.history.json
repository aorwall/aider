Be that way!\"**\n  This is how he responds to silence.\n  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.\n- **\"Whatever.\"**\n  This is what he answers to anything else.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

If `hey_bob` is a question (ends with a '?') and is in uppercase (yelling), return \"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!\".\n2. If `hey_bob` is a question (ends with a '?'), return \"Sure.\".\n3. If `hey_bob` is in uppercase (yelling), return \"Whoa, chill out!\".\n4. If `hey_bob` is empty or contains only whitespace, return \"Fine. Be that way!\".\n5. For all other cases, return \"Whatever.\".\n\nWe can use Python's built-in string methods to check for these conditions. Specifically, `str.endswith()`, `str.isupper()`, and `str.isspace()` can be used to check if a string ends with a certain character, is in uppercase, or contains only whitespace, respectively.",
