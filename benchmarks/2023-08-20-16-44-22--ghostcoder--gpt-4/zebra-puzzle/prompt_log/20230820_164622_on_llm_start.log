Human: # Instructions

Solve the zebra puzzle.

1. There are five houses.
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
12. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.
13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

Each of the five houses is painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and smoke different brands of cigarettes.

Which of the residents drinks water?
Who owns the zebra?

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: zebra_puzzle.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: The Zebra Puzzle is a well-known logic puzzle that can be solved using constraint satisfaction. We can use itertools.permutations to generate all possible arrangements of houses, and then filter out those that don't meet the constraints.

Here's how you can modify the zebra_puzzle.py file:
I updated a file.
Filepath: zebra_puzzle.py
```python
import itertools

def zebra_puzzle():
    "Return a tuple (WATER, ZEBRA) indicating their house numbers."
    houses = first, _, middle, _, _ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    orderings = list(itertools.permutations(houses)) # 1
    return next((WATER, ZEBRA)
                for (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue) in orderings
                if imright(houses.index(ivory), houses.index(green)) # 6
                for (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Japanese, Norwegian) in orderings
                if Englishman == red # 2
                if Norwegian == first # 10
                if nextto(houses.index(Norwegian), houses.index(blue)) # 15
                for (coffee, tea, milk, oj, WATER) in orderings
                if coffee == green # 4
                if Ukrainian == tea # 5
                if milk == middle # 9
                for (OldGold, Kools, Chesterfields, LuckyStrike, Parliaments) in orderings
                if Kools == yellow # 8
                if LuckyStrike == oj # 13
                if Japanese == Parliaments # 14
                for (dog, snails, fox, horse, ZEBRA) in orderings
                if Spaniard == dog # 3
                if OldGold == snails # 7
                if nextto(houses.index(Chesterfields), houses.index(fox)) # 11
                if nextto(houses.index(Kools), houses.index(horse)) # 12
                )

def imright(h1, h2):
    "House h1 is immediately right of h2 if h1-h2 == 1."
    return h1-h2 == 1

def nextto(h1, h2):
    "Two houses are next to each other if they differ by 1."
    return abs(h1-h2) == 1

def drinks_water():
    return zebra_puzzle()[0]

def owns_zebra():
    return zebra_puzzle()[1]
```
In the above code, we first generate all possible permutations of the houses. Then, we iterate over these permutations and check if they satisfy all the constraints given in the problem. If they do, we return the house numbers for the resident who drinks water and the one who owns the zebra. The helper functions `imright` and `nextto` are used to check if a house is immediately to the right of another house and if two houses are next to each other, respectively.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in zebra_puzzle.py to resolve the errors.
