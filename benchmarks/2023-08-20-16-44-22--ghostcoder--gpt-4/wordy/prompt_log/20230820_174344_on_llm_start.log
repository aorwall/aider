Human: # Instructions

Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Iteration 0 — Numbers

Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.

> What is 5?

Evaluates to 5.

## Iteration 1 — Addition

Add two numbers together.

> What is 5 plus 13?

Evaluates to 18.

Handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Now, perform the other three operations.

> What is 7 minus 5?

2

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

24

> What is 25 divided by 5?

5

## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations

Handle a set of operations, in sequence.

Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

24

> What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?

15  (i.e. not 9)

## Iteration 4 — Errors

The parser should reject:

- Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")
- Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")
- Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")
# Instructions append

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the question contains an unknown operation.
raise ValueError("unknown operation")

# if the question is malformed or invalid.
raise ValueError("syntax error")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: wordy.py
AI: To solve this problem, we need to parse the input string and perform the operations as they appear. We can use Python's built-in `split()` function to split the string into a list of words. Then we can iterate over the list and perform the operations as they appear. 

We'll also need to handle errors. If the question doesn't start with "What is", contains an unknown operation, or is malformed, we'll raise a `ValueError`.

Here's the updated `wordy.py`:
I updated a file.
Filepath: wordy.py
```python
def answer(question):
    words = question.replace('?', '').split()
    if words[0:2] != ['What', 'is']:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    result = int(words[2])
    i = 3
    while i < len(words):
        operation = words[i]
        if operation == 'plus':
            result += int(words[i+1])
        elif operation == 'minus':
            result -= int(words[i+1])
        elif operation == 'multiplied':
            if words[i+1] != 'by':
                raise ValueError("syntax error")
            result *= int(words[i+2])
            i += 1
        elif operation == 'divided':
            if words[i+1] != 'by':
                raise ValueError("syntax error")
            result //= int(words[i+2])
            i += 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown operation")
        i += 2

    return result
```
This function starts by splitting the question into words. It then checks that the question starts with "What is", and raises a `ValueError` if it doesn't. It then initializes `result` to the first number in the question.

The function then enters a loop where it performs the operations as they appear in the question. If it encounters an operation it doesn't recognize, it raises a `ValueError`. If it encounters "multiplied" or "divided", it checks that the next word is "by", and raises a `ValueError` if it isn't. It then performs the operation and increments `i` by an additional 1 to skip over the "by".

Finally, the function returns the result.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in wordy.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: wordy.py
```python
def answer(question):
    words = question.replace('?', '').split()
    if words[0:2] != ['What', 'is']:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    result = int(words[2])
    i = 3
    while i < len(words):
        operation = words[i]
        if operation == 'plus':
            result += int(words[i+1])
