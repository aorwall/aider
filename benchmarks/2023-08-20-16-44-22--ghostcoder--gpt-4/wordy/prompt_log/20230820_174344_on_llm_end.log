To solve this problem, we need to parse the input string and perform the operations as they appear. We can use Python's built-in `split()` function to split the string into a list of words. Then we can iterate over the list and perform the operations as they appear. 

We'll also need to handle errors. If the question doesn't start with "What is", contains an unknown operation, or is malformed, we'll raise a `ValueError`.

Here's the updated `wordy.py`:

Filepath: wordy.py
```python
def answer(question):
    words = question.replace('?', '').split()
    if words[0:2] != ['What', 'is']:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    result = int(words[2])
    i = 3
    while i < len(words):
        operation = words[i]
        if operation == 'plus':
            result += int(words[i+1])
        elif operation == 'minus':
            result -= int(words[i+1])
        elif operation == 'multiplied':
            if words[i+1] != 'by':
                raise ValueError("syntax error")
            result *= int(words[i+2])
            i += 1
        elif operation == 'divided':
            if words[i+1] != 'by':
                raise ValueError("syntax error")
            result //= int(words[i+2])
            i += 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown operation")
        i += 2

    return result
```

This function starts by splitting the question into words. It then checks that the question starts with "What is", and raises a `ValueError` if it doesn't. It then initializes `result` to the first number in the question.

The function then enters a loop where it performs the operations as they appear in the question. If it encounters an operation it doesn't recognize, it raises a `ValueError`. If it encounters "multiplied" or "divided", it checks that the next word is "by", and raises a `ValueError` if it isn't. It then performs the operation and increments `i` by an additional 1 to skip over the "by".

Finally, the function returns the result.
