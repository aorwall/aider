These constants will be used to represent the four possible relationships between the two lists.\n\nIn the `sublist` function, we'll first check if the two lists are equal. If they are, we'll return `EQUAL`.\n\nIf the lists are not equal, we'll check if `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two` by checking if `list_one` is a slice of `list_two`. We'll do this by iterating over `list_two` and checking if `list_one` is equal to a slice of `list_two` of the same length as `list_one`. If `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two`, we'll return `SUBLIST`.\n\nIf `list_one` is not a sublist of `list_two`, we'll check if `list_one` is a superlist of `list_two` by doing the same thing but with the roles of `list_one` and `list_two` reversed. If `list_one` is a superlist of `list_two`, we'll return `SUPERLIST`.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, we'll return `UNEQUAL`.\n\nHere is the updated code:",
