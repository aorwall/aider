O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

We convert the input string into a list of lists for easier manipulation. \n\nIn the `get_winner` method, we first check for a path for player 'X'. We start from every cell in the leftmost column and perform a DFS to see if we can reach the rightmost column. If we can, 'X' is the winner. \n\nIf 'X' is not the winner, we perform a similar check for player 'O', but this time we start from every cell in the top row and try to reach the bottom row. \n\nThe DFS is performed by the `dfs` method. It takes the current cell, the target column or row, the player, and a set of visited cells. It first checks if the current cell is out of bounds or has already been visited. If not, it marks the current cell as visited and checks if it has reached the target. If it has, it returns True. If not, it recursively calls `dfs` on all neighboring cells. \n\nHere is the updated code:",
