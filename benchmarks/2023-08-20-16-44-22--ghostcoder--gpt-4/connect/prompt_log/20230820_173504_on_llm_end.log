To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check if there is a path from one side of the board to the other for each player. 

We start by initializing the board in the `__init__` method. We convert the input string into a list of lists for easier manipulation. 

In the `get_winner` method, we first check for a path for player 'X'. We start from every cell in the leftmost column and perform a DFS to see if we can reach the rightmost column. If we can, 'X' is the winner. 

If 'X' is not the winner, we perform a similar check for player 'O', but this time we start from every cell in the top row and try to reach the bottom row. 

The DFS is performed by the `dfs` method. It takes the current cell, the target column or row, the player, and a set of visited cells. It first checks if the current cell is out of bounds or has already been visited. If not, it marks the current cell as visited and checks if it has reached the target. If it has, it returns True. If not, it recursively calls `dfs` on all neighboring cells. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = [list(row) for row in board.split("\n")]

    def get_winner(self):
        for i in range(len(self.board)):
            if self.dfs(i, 0, 'X', len(self.board[0])-1, set()):
                return 'X'
        for j in range(len(self.board[0])):
            if self.dfs(0, j, 'O', len(self.board)-1, set()):
                return 'O'
        return ''

    def dfs(self, i, j, player, target, visited):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(self.board) or j < 0 or j >= len(self.board[0]) or (i, j) in visited or self.board[i][j] != player:
            return False
        if (player == 'X' and j == target) or (player == 'O' and i == target):
            return True
        visited.add((i, j))
        return self.dfs(i-1, j, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i, j-1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i, j+1, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i-1, j+1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j-1, player, target, visited)
```

This code should correctly compute the winner of a Hex / Polygon game.
