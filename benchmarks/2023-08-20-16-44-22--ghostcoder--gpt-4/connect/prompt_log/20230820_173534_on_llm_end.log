The issue seems to be with the way the board is being processed. The board is a parallelogram, but it's being treated as a rectangle in the code. This is causing the DFS to not find valid paths even when they exist.

To fix this, we need to adjust the indices used in the DFS to account for the offset in each row caused by the parallelogram shape. We can do this by subtracting the row index from the column index in the DFS function.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = [list(row) for row in board.split("\n")]

    def get_winner(self):
        for i in range(len(self.board)):
            if self.dfs(i, 0, 'X', len(self.board[0])-1, set()):
                return 'X'
        for j in range(len(self.board[0])):
            if self.dfs(0, j, 'O', len(self.board)-1, set()):
                return 'O'
        return ''

    def dfs(self, i, j, player, target, visited):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(self.board) or j < i or j >= len(self.board[0]) + i or (i, j) in visited or self.board[i][j] != player:
            return False
        if (player == 'X' and j - i == target) or (player == 'O' and i == target):
            return True
        visited.add((i, j))
        return self.dfs(i-1, j, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i, j-1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i, j+1, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i-1, j+1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j-1, player, target, visited)
```
This code should correctly compute the winner of a Hex / Polygon game, taking into account the parallelogram shape of the board.
