To solve this problem, we need to iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, we check if it's the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column. If it is, we add its coordinates to the list of saddle points.

Here's how we can implement this:

Filepath: saddle_points.py
```python
def saddle_points(matrix):
    if any(len(row) != len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("irregular matrix")

    points = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
                points.append((i, j))
    return points
```

In the code above, we first check if the matrix is irregular. If it is, we raise a ValueError with a meaningful message. Then we initialize an empty list `points` to store the coordinates of the saddle points.

We use two nested loops to iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, we check if it's the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column. If it is, we add its coordinates to the list of saddle points.

Finally, we return the list of saddle points.
