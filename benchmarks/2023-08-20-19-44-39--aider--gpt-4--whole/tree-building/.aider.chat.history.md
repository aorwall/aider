#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a tree building algorithm.  
####   
#### Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.  
#### However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.  
#### Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.  
####   
#### Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.  
#### The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.  
#### The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).  
#### All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.  
####   
#### An example tree:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)  
#### |-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)  
#### |    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)  
#### +-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)  
#### +-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current implementation of the tree building algorithm is inefficient and can be improved. The main issue is that it uses nested loops to iterate over the records and the nodes, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). 

We can refactor the code to use a dictionary to store the nodes by their IDs, which will allow us to access them in constant time. We can also simplify the validation of the records by checking the conditions in a single loop.

Here is the refactored code:

tree_building.py
```
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []


def BuildTree(records):
    if not records:
        return None

    records.sort(key=lambda r: r.record_id)
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}

    if records[0].record_id != 0 or records[0].parent_id != 0:
        raise ValueError("The root record has not ID 0 or its parent ID is not 0")

    for r in records:
        if r.record_id < r.parent_id:
            raise ValueError("A record's ID is less than its parent's ID")
        if r.record_id != 0 and r.record_id == r.parent_id:
            raise ValueError("A non-root record has the same ID as its parent ID")
        if r.record_id != 0:
            nodes[r.parent_id].children.append(nodes[r.record_id])

    return nodes[0]
```
This refactored code is more efficient and easier to understand. It first creates a dictionary of nodes from the records, then it validates the records and builds the tree in a single loop. The time complexity is now O(n), where n is the number of records.

The error messages in the `BuildTree` function in `tree_building.py` do not match the expected error messages in the tests. We need to update the error messages to match the expected ones.

Here is the updated `tree_building.py`:

```python
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []


def BuildTree(records):
    if not records:
        return None

    records.sort(key=lambda r: r.record_id)
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}

    if records[0].record_id != 0 or records[0].parent_id != 0:
        raise ValueError("Record id is invalid or out of order.")

    for r in records:
        if r.record_id < r.parent_id:
            raise ValueError("Node parent_id should be smaller than it's record_id.")
        if r.record_id != 0 and r.record_id == r.parent_id:
            raise ValueError("Only root should have equal record and parent id.")
        if r.record_id != 0:
            nodes[r.parent_id].children.append(nodes[r.record_id])

    return nodes[0]
```

This should resolve the test failures.
