#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You bought a big box of random computer parts at a garage sale.  
#### You've started putting the parts together to build custom computers.  
####   
#### You want to test the performance of different combinations of parts, and decide to create your own benchmarking program to see how your computers compare.  
#### You choose the famous "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm, an ancient algorithm, but one that should push your computers to the limits.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to create a program that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers.  
####   
#### A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.  
#### For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.  
####   
#### The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm that works by taking a list of numbers and crossing out all the numbers that aren't prime.  
####   
#### A number that is **not** prime is called a "composite number".  
####   
#### To use the Sieve of Eratosthenes, you first create a list of all the numbers between 2 and your given number.  
#### Then you repeat the following steps:  
####   
#### 1. Find the next unmarked number in your list. This is a prime number.  
#### 2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as composite (not prime).  
####   
#### You keep repeating these steps until you've gone through every number in your list.  
#### At the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### [Wikipedia's Sieve of Eratosthenes article][eratosthenes] has a useful graphic that explains the algorithm.  
####   
#### The tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct list of primes.  
#### A good first test is to check that you do not use division or remainder operations.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be implemented in Python using a list comprehension and a while loop. Here's how you can modify the `primes` function in the `sieve.py` file:

sieve.py
```
def primes(limit):
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
    p = 2
    while p * p <= limit:
        if sieve[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                sieve[i] = False
        p += 1
    return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if sieve[p]]
```

In this code, we first create a list `sieve` of boolean values representing whether each index is prime or not. We assume all numbers are prime at the start (hence `True`), except numbers 0 and 1 which are not prime.

Then we start from the first prime number, which is 2, and mark all of its multiples as composite (not prime). We do this by setting the corresponding index in the `sieve` list to `False`.

We continue this process for all numbers up to the square root of the limit. This is because a larger factor of the number must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been processed.

Finally, we use a list comprehension to generate a list of all prime numbers by selecting indices in the `sieve` that are still `True`.

This function will return a list of all prime numbers up to the given limit.
