#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage a game player's High Score list.  
####   
#### Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.  
#### Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

Based on the instructions, we need to add methods to the `HighScores` class to return the highest score, the last added score, and the three highest scores. Here's how we can do it:

high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

In the `__init__` method, we store the scores in `self.scores`. 

The `latest` method returns the last score in the list, which is the latest score.

The `personal_best` method returns the highest score in the list.

The `personal_top_three` method sorts the scores in descending order and returns the first three scores, which are the top three scores. If there are less than three scores, it returns all of them.
