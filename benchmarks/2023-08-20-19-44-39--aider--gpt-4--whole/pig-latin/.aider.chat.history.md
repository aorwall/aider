#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.  
####   
#### Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.  
#### It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.  
####   
#### - **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.  
####   Please note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay").  
#### - **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.  
####   Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, such as the "ch" in "chair" or "st" in "stand" (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").  
#### - **Rule 3**: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay").  
#### - **Rule 4**: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word it makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").  
####   
#### There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.  
#### Check the tests for all the details.  
####   
#### Read more about [Pig Latin on Wikipedia][pig-latin].  
####   
#### [pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig_latin.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Pig Latin translator, we need to follow the rules you provided. We'll use Python's built-in string and list methods to manipulate the words. Here's how we can implement it:

1. We'll start by splitting the input text into words.
2. For each word, we'll check if it starts with a vowel sound. If it does, we'll simply add "ay" to the end of the word.
3. If the word starts with a consonant sound, we'll find the index of the first vowel in the word, move all the characters before the vowel to the end of the word, and then add "ay".
4. We'll handle the special cases of "qu" and "y" as described in the rules.
5. Finally, we'll join all the translated words back into a sentence.

Here's the updated code:

pig_latin.py
```
def translate(text):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    words = text.split()
    result = []

    for word in words:
        if word[0] in vowels or word[:2] in ['xr', 'yt']:
            result.append(word + 'ay')
        else:
            if 'qu' in word:
                idx = word.index('qu') + 2
            else:
                idx = min([word.index(v) for v in vowels if v in word])
            if word[idx-1] == 'y':
                idx -= 1
            result.append(word[idx:] + word[:idx] + 'ay')

    return ' '.join(result)
```
This function should now correctly translate English text into Pig Latin according to the rules you provided.

The current implementation of the `translate` function in `pig_latin.py` is not handling the cases where "y" is treated as a vowel at the end of a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word. It also fails to treat "y" as a consonant at the beginning of a word. 

To fix these issues, we need to modify the `translate` function to handle these special cases. 

Here is the updated `pig_latin.py`:

pig_latin.py
```
def translate(text):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    words = text.split()
    result = []

    for word in words:
        if word[0] in vowels or word[:2] in ['xr', 'yt']:
            result.append(word + 'ay')
        elif word[0] == 'y':
            result.append(word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay')
        else:
            if 'qu' in word:
                idx = word.index('qu') + 2
            elif 'y' in word:
                idx = word.index('y')
            else:
                idx = min([i for i, letter in enumerate(word) if letter in vowels])
            result.append(word[idx:] + word[:idx] + 'ay')

    return ' '.join(result)
```
This updated function now correctly handles the special cases involving "y". It checks if the word starts with "y" and treats it as a consonant. If "y" is found elsewhere in the word, it is treated as a vowel. The function also correctly handles the "qu" case.
