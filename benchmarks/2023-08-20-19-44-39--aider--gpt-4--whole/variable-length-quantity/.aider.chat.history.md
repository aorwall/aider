#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the sequence is incomplete  
#### raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement two functions: `encode` and `decode`. The `encode` function will take a list of integers and return their variable length quantity (VLQ) encoding. The `decode` function will take a list of VLQ encoded bytes and return the original integers. If the sequence to decode is incomplete, we should raise a `ValueError` with the message "incomplete sequence".

Here is the updated code:

variable_length_quantity.py
```
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        bytes_ = []
        while True:
            bytes_.insert(0, number & 0x7F)
            if number < 128:
                break
            number = number >> 7
        bytes_[-1] |= 0x80
        result.extend(bytes_)
    return result


def decode(bytes_):
    numbers = []
    number = 0
    for byte in bytes_:
        number = (number << 7) | (byte & 0x7F)
        if byte & 0x80:
            numbers.append(number)
            number = 0
    if number != 0:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    return numbers
```

In the `encode` function, we iterate over each number and convert it to a list of bytes where only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant. We then set the 7th bit of the last byte to indicate that it is the last byte of the series.

In the `decode` function, we iterate over each byte and convert it back to the original number. If the 7th bit of a byte is set, we know that it is the last byte of the series and we append the number to the result list. If we have a non-zero number left after iterating over all bytes, we know that the sequence is incomplete and we raise a `ValueError`.

The errors in the tests are due to incorrect implementation of the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `variable_length_quantity.py` file. 

In the `encode` function, the last byte of the encoded number should have its most significant bit set to 0, not 1. This is done by the line `bytes_[-1] |= 0x80`, which should be replaced with `bytes_[-1] &= 0x7F`.

In the `decode` function, the condition to append the number to the result list and reset the number is when the most significant bit of the byte is 0, not 1. This is done by the line `if byte & 0x80:`, which should be replaced with `if not byte & 0x80:`.

Here is the corrected code:

variable_length_quantity.py
```
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        bytes_ = []
        while True:
            bytes_.insert(0, number & 0x7F)
            if number < 128:
                break
            number = number >> 7
        bytes_[-1] &= 0x7F
        result.extend(bytes_)
    return result


def decode(bytes_):
    numbers = []
    number = 0
    for byte in bytes_:
        number = (number << 7) | (byte & 0x7F)
        if not byte & 0x80:
            numbers.append(number)
            number = 0
    if number != 0:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    return numbers
```
