#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You teach English as a foreign language to high school students.  
####   
#### You've decided to base your entire curriculum on TV shows.  
#### You need to analyze which words are used, and how often they're repeated.  
####   
#### This will let you choose the simplest shows to start with, and to gradually increase the difficulty as time passes.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to count how many times each word occurs in a subtitle of a drama.  
####   
#### The subtitles from these dramas use only ASCII characters.  
####   
#### The characters often speak in casual English, using contractions like _they're_ or _it's_.  
#### Though these contractions come from two words (e.g. _we are_), the contraction (_we're_) is considered a single word.  
####   
#### Words can be separated by any form of punctuation (e.g. ":", "!", or "?") or whitespace (e.g. "\t", "\n", or " ").  
#### The only punctuation that does not separate words is the apostrophe in contractions.  
####   
#### Numbers are considered words.  
#### If the subtitles say _It costs 100 dollars._ then _100_ will be its own word.  
####   
#### Words are case insensitive.  
#### For example, the word _you_ occurs three times in the following sentence:  
####   
#### > You come back, you hear me? DO YOU HEAR ME?  
####   
#### The ordering of the word counts in the results doesn't matter.  
####   
#### Here's an example that incorporates several of the elements discussed above:  
####   
#### - simple words  
#### - contractions  
#### - numbers  
#### - case insensitive words  
#### - punctuation (including apostrophes) to separate words  
#### - different forms of whitespace to separate words  
####   
#### `"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.\nSo I fled.`  
####   
#### The mapping for this subtitle would be:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 123: 1  
#### agent: 1  
#### cried: 1  
#### fled: 1  
#### i: 1  
#### password: 2  
#### so: 1  
#### special: 1  
#### that's: 1  
#### the: 2  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_count.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The task requires us to count the frequency of each word in a given sentence. The words are separated by any form of punctuation or whitespace, except for the apostrophe in contractions. The words are case insensitive and numbers are also considered as words.

To implement this, we need to:

1. Convert the sentence to lowercase to handle the case insensitivity.
2. Replace all punctuation with whitespace, except for the apostrophe in contractions.
3. Split the sentence into words.
4. Count the frequency of each word.

Here is the updated code:

word_count.py
```
import re
from collections import Counter

def count_words(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    sentence = re.sub(r"[^\w\s']", ' ', sentence)
    words = sentence.split()
    return dict(Counter(words))
```

In this code, we first convert the sentence to lowercase. Then we replace all non-word, non-whitespace, and non-apostrophe characters with whitespace using a regular expression. We split the sentence into words and count the frequency of each word using the Counter class from the collections module. The result is then converted to a dictionary and returned.

The current implementation of the `count_words` function in `word_count.py` is not handling apostrophes correctly. It is treating apostrophes as part of the word, which is causing the function to fail tests where words are surrounded by apostrophes or where apostrophes are used in contractions.

To fix this, we need to modify the regular expression used in the `re.sub` function. The current regular expression `r"[^\w\s']"` is replacing all characters that are not word characters, not whitespace, and not apostrophes. This is causing words surrounded by apostrophes to be treated as a single word.

We need to modify the regular expression to only consider apostrophes as part of the word when they are surrounded by word characters (indicating a contraction). We can do this by using a negative lookbehind and lookahead in the regular expression to check that the apostrophe is not preceded or followed by a non-word character.

Here is the updated `word_count.py` file:

word_count.py
```
import re
from collections import Counter

def count_words(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    sentence = re.sub(r"(?<!\w)'|'(?!\w)", ' ', sentence)
    sentence = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", ' ', sentence)
    words = sentence.split()
    return dict(Counter(words))
```

In this updated version, we first replace all apostrophes that are not part of a contraction with a space using the regular expression `r"(?<!\w)'|'(?!\w)"`. Then we replace all non-word and non-whitespace characters with a space using the regular expression `r"[^\w\s]"`. This ensures that words surrounded by apostrophes and contractions are handled correctly.
