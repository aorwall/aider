#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.  
####

To implement this, we need to modify the `ConnectGame` class in the `connect.py` file. We will add a method to check if a player has won the game. 

The `__init__` method will be updated to initialize the board and determine the size of the board. 

The `get_winner` method will be updated to check if either player has won the game. It will do this by checking if there is a path from one side of the board to the other for each player. 

Here is the updated `connect.py` file:

connect.py
```
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = [list(row) for row in board.split("\n") if row]
        self.height = len(self.board)
        self.width = len(self.board[0])

    def get_winner(self):
        for player in ['X', 'O']:
            if self.check_winner(player):
                return player
        return ''

    def check_winner(self, player):
        stack = []
        visited = set()
        if player == 'X':
            stack = [(0, i) for i, cell in enumerate(self.board[0]) if cell == player]
        elif player == 'O':
            stack = [(i, 0) for i, row in enumerate(self.board) if row[0] == player]

        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            if player == 'X' and x == self.width - 1 or player == 'O' and y == self.height - 1:
                return True
            if (x, y) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < self.width and 0 <= ny < self.height and self.board[ny][nx] == player:
                    stack.append((nx, ny))
        return False
```
This code uses a depth-first search to check if there is a path from one side of the board to the other for each player. The `check_winner` method starts from one side of the board and tries to reach the other side by moving to adjacent cells of the same player. If it can reach the other side, then that player has won.

The issue seems to be with the way the starting points for the 'X' and 'O' players are being determined. The current implementation only considers the first row for 'X' and the first column for 'O'. However, the 'X' player can start from any row, and the 'O' player can start from any column. 

Here is the corrected code:

connect.py
```
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = [list(row) for row in board.split("\n") if row]
        self.height = len(self.board)
        self.width = len(self.board[0])

    def get_winner(self):
        for player in ['X', 'O']:
            if self.check_winner(player):
                return player
        return ''

    def check_winner(self, player):
        stack = []
        visited = set()
        if player == 'X':
            stack = [(i, j) for i in range(self.height) for j, cell in enumerate(self.board[i]) if cell == player]
        elif player == 'O':
            stack = [(i, j) for j in range(self.width) for i, cell in enumerate(self.board[j]) if cell == player]

        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            if player == 'X' and y == self.width - 1 or player == 'O' and x == self.height - 1:
                return True
            if (x, y) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < self.height and 0 <= ny < self.width and self.board[nx][ny] == player:
                    stack.append((nx, ny))
        return False
```
This code now checks all cells for the starting point of each player. It also corrects the condition to check if a player has won. For 'X', it checks if any of its stones have reached the last column (y == self.width - 1), and for 'O', it checks if any of its stones have reached the last row (x == self.height - 1).
