#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Note that mathematically, the denominator can't be zero.  
#### However in many implementations of rational numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.  
#### In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.  
####   
#### The sum of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ + r₂ = a₁/b₁ + a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The difference of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ - r₂ = a₁/b₁ - a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ * r₂ = (a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### Dividing a rational number `r₁ = a₁/b₁` by another `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ / r₂ = (a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)` if `a₂` is not zero.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,  
#### - absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.  
####   
#### Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.  
#### For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.  
#### To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.  
#### So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.  
#### The reduced form of a rational number should be in "standard form" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).  
#### If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.  
#### For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`  
####   
#### Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rational_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the operations for the Rational class. Here are the changes:

rational_numbers.py
```
import math

class Rational:
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        if denom == 0:
            raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")
        gcd = math.gcd(numer, denom)
        self.numer = numer // gcd
        self.denom = denom // gcd
        if self.denom < 0:
            self.numer *= -1
            self.denom *= -1

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.numer == other.numer and self.denom == other.denom

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'{self.numer}/{self.denom}'

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Rational(self.numer * other.denom + self.denom * other.numer, self.denom * other.denom)

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Rational(self.numer * other.denom - self.denom * other.numer, self.denom * other.denom)

    def __mul__(self, other):
        return Rational(self.numer * other.numer, self.denom * other.denom)

    def __truediv__(self, other):
        if other.numer == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return Rational(self.numer * other.denom, self.denom * other.numer)

    def __abs__(self):
        return Rational(abs(self.numer), abs(self.denom))

    def __pow__(self, power):
        if power >= 0:
            return Rational(self.numer ** power, self.denom ** power)
        else:
            return Rational(self.denom ** abs(power), self.numer ** abs(power))

    def __rpow__(self, base):
        return (base ** self.numer) ** (1 / self.denom)
```

This code implements all the operations for the Rational class as per the instructions. The `__init__` method has been updated to reduce the rational number to its lowest terms and ensure the denominator is always positive. The `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__` methods implement the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations respectively. The `__abs__` method returns the absolute value of the rational number. The `__pow__` method implements exponentiation of a rational number to an integer power, and the `__rpow__` method implements exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.
