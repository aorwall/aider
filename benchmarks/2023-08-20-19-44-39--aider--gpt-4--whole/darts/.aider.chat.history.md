#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance from the point (x, y) to the center of the target (0, 0). This can be done using the Pythagorean theorem. Then we can use this distance to determine in which circle the dart landed and return the corresponding score.

Here is the updated code:

darts.py
```
def score(x, y):
    distance = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
    if distance > 10:
        return 0
    elif distance > 5:
        return 1
    elif distance > 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
```
This function first calculates the distance from the point to the center of the target. Then it checks in which circle the dart landed by comparing the distance to the radii of the circles. It returns the score corresponding to the circle in which the dart landed.
