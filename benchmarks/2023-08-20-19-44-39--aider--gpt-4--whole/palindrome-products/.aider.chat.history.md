#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Detect palindrome products in a given range.  
####   
#### A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.  
#### For example, `121` is a palindromic number but `112` is not.  
####   
#### Given a range of numbers, find the largest and smallest palindromes which  
#### are products of two numbers within that range.  
####   
#### Your solution should return the largest and smallest palindromes, along with the factors of each within the range.  
#### If the largest or smallest palindrome has more than one pair of factors within the range, then return all the pairs.  
####   
#### ## Example 1  
####   
#### Given the range `[1, 9]` (both inclusive)...  
####   
#### And given the list of all possible products within this range:  
#### `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 15, 21, 24, 27, 20, 28, 32, 36, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 42, 48, 54, 49, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81]`  
####   
#### The palindrome products are all single digit numbers (in this case):  
#### `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  
####   
#### The smallest palindrome product is `1`.  
#### Its factors are `(1, 1)`.  
#### The largest palindrome product is `9`.  
#### Its factors are `(1, 9)` and `(3, 3)`.  
####   
#### ## Example 2  
####   
#### Given the range `[10, 99]` (both inclusive)...  
####   
#### The smallest palindrome product is `121`.  
#### Its factors are `(11, 11)`.  
#### The largest palindrome product is `9009`.  
#### Its factors are `(91, 99)`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Notes regarding the implementation of `smallest` and `largest`:  
####   
#### Both functions must take two keyword arguments:  
#### - `max_factor`: int  
#### - `min_factor`: int, default 0  
####   
#### Their return value must be a `tuple -- (value, factors)` where `value` is the  
#### palindrome itself, and `factors` is an `iterable` containing both factors of the  
#### palindrome in arbitrary order.  
####   
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `largest()` or `smallest()` function receives a pair of factors that are not in the correct range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the max_factor is less than the min_factor  
#### raise ValueError("min must be <= max")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: palindrome_products.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `largest` and `smallest` functions in the `palindrome_products.py` file. 

The `largest` function should iterate over the range of numbers from `min_factor` to `max_factor` (both inclusive), calculate the product of each pair of numbers, and keep track of the largest palindrome product and its factors.

The `smallest` function should do the same but keep track of the smallest palindrome product and its factors.

We also need to add a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome.

Here is the updated `palindrome_products.py` file:

palindrome_products.py
```
def is_palindrome(n):
    """Check if a number is a palindrome.

    :param n: int
    :return: bool
    """
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]


def largest(min_factor, max_factor):
    """Given a range of numbers, find the largest palindromes which
       are products of two numbers within that range.

    :param min_factor: int with a default value of 0
    :param max_factor: int
    :return: tuple of (palindrome, iterable).
             Iterable should contain both factors of the palindrome in an arbitrary order.
    """
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    max_palindrome = 0
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if is_palindrome(product) and product > max_palindrome:
                max_palindrome = product
                factors = [(i, j)]

    return max_palindrome, factors


def smallest(min_factor, max_factor):
    """Given a range of numbers, find the smallest palindromes which
    are products of two numbers within that range.

    :param min_factor: int with a default value of 0
    :param max_factor: int
    :return: tuple of (palindrome, iterable).
    Iterable should contain both factors of the palindrome in an arbitrary order.
    """
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    min_palindrome = float('inf')
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if is_palindrome(product) and product < min_palindrome:
                min_palindrome = product
                factors = [(i, j)]

    return min_palindrome, factors
```
This code should work as expected according to the instructions. It checks for palindrome products in the given range and returns the smallest and largest ones along with their factors. It also raises a `ValueError` if `min_factor` is greater than `max_factor`.

The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `largest` and `smallest` functions are not handling the case when there are no palindrome products in the given range. In such cases, these functions should return `None` for the palindrome and an empty list for the factors.

2. The `largest` and `smallest` functions are not handling the case when there are multiple pairs of factors for the largest or smallest palindrome. In such cases, these functions should return all the pairs of factors.

Here is the corrected code:
