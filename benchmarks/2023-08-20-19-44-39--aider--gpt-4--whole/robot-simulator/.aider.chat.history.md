#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a robot simulator.  
####   
#### A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.  
####   
#### The robots have three possible movements:  
####   
#### - turn right  
#### - turn left  
#### - advance  
####   
#### Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,  
#### e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.  
####   
#### The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.  
####   
#### - The letter-string "RAALAL" means:  
####   - Turn right  
####   - Advance twice  
####   - Turn left  
####   - Advance once  
####   - Turn left yet again  
#### - Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.  
####   Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The instructions provided require changes to the `robot_simulator.py` file. The `Robot` class needs to be implemented to handle the robot's movements and track its position and direction. The global direction variables also need to be assigned appropriate values.

Here is the updated `robot_simulator.py` file:

robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'EAST'
NORTH = 'NORTH'
WEST = 'WEST'
SOUTH = 'SOUTH'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x=0, y=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.coordinates = (x, y)

    def turn_right(self):
        directions = [NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST]
        current_index = directions.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = directions[(current_index + 1) % 4]

    def turn_left(self):
        directions = [NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST]
        current_index = directions.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = directions[(current_index - 1) % 4]

    def advance(self):
        x, y = self.coordinates
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.coordinates = (x, y + 1)
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.coordinates = (x + 1, y)
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.coordinates = (x, y - 1)
        else:  # self.direction == WEST
            self.coordinates = (x - 1, y)

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
```
This code defines a `Robot` class with methods for turning right, turning left, and advancing. The robot's current direction and coordinates are stored as instance variables. The `move` method takes a string of instructions and executes them in order. The global direction variables are assigned string values representing the four cardinal directions.
