#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.  
####   
#### Your body is made up of cells that contain DNA.  
#### Those cells regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by dividing into daughter cells.  
#### In fact, the average human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!  
####   
#### When cells divide, their DNA replicates too.  
#### Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information.  
#### If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred.  
#### This is known as the "Hamming Distance".  
####   
#### We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T.  
#### Two strands might look like this:  
####   
####     GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT  
####     CATCGTAATGACGGCCT  
####     ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^  
####   
#### They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.  
####   
#### The Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not just biology, so it's a nice phrase to be familiar with :)  
####   
#### ## Implementation notes  
####   
#### The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the strands being checked are not the same length. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # When the sequences being passed are not the same length.  
#### raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hamming.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `distance` function in the `hamming.py` file. This function should calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands. If the strands are not of equal length, it should raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

Here is the updated `hamming.py` file:

hamming.py
```
def distance(strand_a, strand_b):
    if len(strand_a) != len(strand_b):
        raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")
    return sum(a != b for a, b in zip(strand_a, strand_b))
```

In this updated function, we first check if the lengths of the two strands are equal. If they are not, we raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the strands must be of equal length. If the strands are of equal length, we calculate the Hamming distance by comparing each pair of corresponding elements in the two strands. The `zip` function pairs up the elements of the two strands, and the `sum` function counts the number of pairs that are not equal.
