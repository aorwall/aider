#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).  
#### Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.  
#### However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).  
####   
#### Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.  
#### Note that Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Limit: 10  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
####   
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The problem you're describing is a classic problem in computer science known as the Knapsack Problem. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. 

Here's how we can modify the `maximum_value` function in `knapsack.py` to solve this problem:

knapsack.py
```
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize a 2D array for storing the maximum value for each weight
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(maximum_weight + 1)] for _ in range(len(items) + 1)]
    
    # Iterate over the items
    for i in range(1, len(items) + 1):
        for w in range(1, maximum_weight + 1):
            # If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current weight
            if items[i - 1]['weight'] <= w:
                # Update the maximum value for the current weight
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - items[i - 1]['weight']] + items[i - 1]['value'])
            else:
                # If the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight, use the previous item's value
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    
    # Return the maximum value
    return dp[len(items)][maximum_weight]
```

This function uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with a weight limit of `w` using the first `i` items. It then iterates over the items and for each item, it updates the maximum value for each weight. Finally, it returns the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight limit.
