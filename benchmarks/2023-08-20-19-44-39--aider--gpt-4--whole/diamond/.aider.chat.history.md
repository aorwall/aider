#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.  
#### Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### - The first row contains one 'A'.  
#### - The last row contains one 'A'.  
#### - All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.  
#### - All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).  
#### - The diamond is horizontally symmetric.  
#### - The diamond is vertically symmetric.  
#### - The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).  
#### - The letters form a diamond shape.  
#### - The top half has the letters in ascending order.  
#### - The bottom half has the letters in descending order.  
#### - The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'A':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### A  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'C':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ··A··  
#### ·B·B·  
#### C···C  
#### ·B·B·  
#### ··A··  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'E':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ····A····  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### E·······E  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ····A····  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The task requires us to create a diamond shape with letters. The widest point of the diamond will be the input letter. The diamond starts and ends with 'A'. The diamond is symmetric both horizontally and vertically. 

To achieve this, we need to modify the `rows` function in the `diamond.py` file. The function will take a letter as input and return a list of strings representing the rows of the diamond.

Here is the updated `diamond.py` file:

diamond.py
```
def rows(letter):
    size = ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1
    diamond = []

    for i in range(size):
        row = [' '] * (size * 2 - 1)
        row[size - i - 1] = row[size + i - 1] = chr(ord('A') + i)
        diamond.append(''.join(row))

    return diamond + diamond[-2::-1]
```

In this function, we first calculate the size of the diamond, which is the ASCII value of the input letter minus the ASCII value of 'A' plus 1. We then create an empty list `diamond` to store the rows of the diamond.

We then iterate over the range of the size. For each iteration, we create a row with spaces, and replace the spaces at the appropriate indices with the corresponding letter. We append the row to the `diamond` list.

Finally, we return the `diamond` list concatenated with a reversed copy of itself excluding the last element. This creates the bottom half of the diamond.
