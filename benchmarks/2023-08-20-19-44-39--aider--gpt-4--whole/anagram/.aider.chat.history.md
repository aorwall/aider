#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.  
#### A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.  
####   
#### Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.  
####   
#### The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).  
#### Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.  
#### The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).  
#### Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.  
####   
#### Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the anagram finder, we need to compare the sorted characters of the target word with the sorted characters of each candidate word. If they match and the candidate word is not identical to the target word, then it's an anagram. We also need to make sure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the updated code:

anagram.py
```
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    word_lower = word.lower()
    sorted_word = sorted(word_lower)
    return [candidate for candidate in candidates if sorted_word == sorted(candidate.lower()) and word_lower != candidate.lower()]
```

This function works by first converting the target word to lowercase and sorting its characters. Then it iterates over the candidates, converting each to lowercase, sorting its characters, and comparing it to the sorted target word. If they match and the candidate is not identical to the target (ignoring case), then it's an anagram and is included in the output list.
