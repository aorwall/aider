#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
#### For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!  
####   
#### The band colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### From the example above:  
#### brown-green should return 15  
#### brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_duo.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to modify the `value` function in the `resistor_color_duo.py` file. The function should take a list of color names as input and return a two-digit number based on the color encoding scheme. If more than two colors are provided, the function should ignore the extra colors.

Here is the updated `resistor_color_duo.py` file:

resistor_color_duo.py
```
def value(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    return color_codes[colors[0]] * 10 + color_codes[colors[1]]
```

In this updated code, we first define a dictionary `color_codes` that maps color names to their corresponding numeric values. Then, we return the two-digit number formed by the first two colors in the input list. We multiply the value of the first color by 10 and add the value of the second color to form the two-digit number. If more than two colors are provided, the extra colors are ignored as they do not affect the calculation.
