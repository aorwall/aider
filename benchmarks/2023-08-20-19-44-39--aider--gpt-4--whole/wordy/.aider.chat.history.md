#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 0 — Numbers  
####   
#### Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.  
####   
#### > What is 5?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 5.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 1 — Addition  
####   
#### Add two numbers together.  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 18.  
####   
#### Handle large numbers and negative numbers.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division  
####   
#### Now, perform the other three operations.  
####   
#### > What is 7 minus 5?  
####   
#### 2  
####   
#### > What is 6 multiplied by 4?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 25 divided by 5?  
####   
#### 5  
####   
#### ## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations  
####   
#### Handle a set of operations, in sequence.  
####   
#### Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?  
####   
#### 15  (i.e. not 9)  
####   
#### ## Iteration 4 — Errors  
####   
#### The parser should reject:  
####   
#### - Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")  
#### - Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")  
#### - Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the question contains an unknown operation.  
#### raise ValueError("unknown operation")  
####   
#### # if the question is malformed or invalid.  
#### raise ValueError("syntax error")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to modify the `answer` function in the `wordy.py` file to parse and evaluate simple math word problems. We will use Python's built-in string methods to parse the question and perform the appropriate mathematical operation. We will also add error handling to raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message when the question is malformed/invalid or contains an unknown operation.

Here is the updated `wordy.py` file:

wordy.py
```
def answer(question):
    question = question.replace("What is ", "").replace("?", "")
    parts = question.split()

    if len(parts) % 2 == 0:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    try:
        result = int(parts[0])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):
        operator = parts[i]
        try:
            number = int(parts[i + 1])
        except ValueError:
            raise ValueError("syntax error")

        if operator == "plus":
            result += number
        elif operator == "minus":
            result -= number
        elif operator == "multiplied by":
            result *= number
        elif operator == "divided by":
            if number == 0:
                raise ValueError("division by zero")
            result //= number
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown operation")

    return result
```
This function works by first removing the "What is " prefix and the "?" suffix from the question, then splitting the remaining string into parts. It then checks if the number of parts is odd, as a valid question should have an odd number of parts (a number, followed by pairs of an operator and a number). If the number of parts is even, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "syntax error".

Next, it tries to convert the first part to an integer to get the initial result. If this fails, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "syntax error".

Then, it iterates over the remaining parts in pairs (an operator and a number), performing the appropriate operation on the result and the number. If it encounters an unknown operator, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "unknown operation". If it encounters a division by zero, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "division by zero".

Finally, it returns the result.

The current implementation of the `answer` function in `wordy.py` is not correctly handling operations that consist of two words, such as "multiplied by" and "divided by". This is causing the function to incorrectly try to convert the word "by" into an integer, which is causing a `ValueError`.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly handle these two-word operations. We can do this by checking if the current operator is "multiplied" or "divided", and if so, we should combine it with the next word to form the full operation.

Here is the corrected code:

wordy.py
```
def answer(question):
    question = question.replace("What is ", "").replace("?", "")
    parts = question.split()

    if len(parts) % 2 == 0:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    try:
        result = int(parts[0])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    i = 1
    while i < len(parts):
        operator = parts[i]
        if operator == "multiplied" or operator == "divided":
            operator += " " + parts[i + 1]
            i += 1

        try:
            number = int(parts[i + 1])
        except ValueError:
            raise ValueError("syntax error")

        if operator == "plus":
            result += number
        elif operator == "minus":
            result -= number
        elif operator == "multiplied by":
            result *= number
        elif operator == "divided by":
            if number == 0:
                raise ValueError("division by zero")
            result //= number
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown operation")

        i += 2

    return result
```
