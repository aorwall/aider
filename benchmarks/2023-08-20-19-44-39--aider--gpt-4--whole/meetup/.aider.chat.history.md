#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recurring monthly meetups are generally scheduled on the given weekday of a given week each month.  
#### In this exercise you will be given the recurring schedule, along with a month and year, and then asked to find the exact date of the meetup.  
####   
#### For example a meetup might be scheduled on the _first Monday_ of every month.  
#### You might then be asked to find the date that this meetup will happen in January 2018.  
#### In other words, you need to determine the date of the first Monday of January 2018.  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
####   
#### The descriptors you are expected to process are: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### Note that descriptor `teenth` is a made-up word.  
####   
#### It refers to the seven numbers that end in '-teen' in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  
#### But general descriptions of dates use ordinal numbers, e.g. the _first_ Monday, the _third_ Tuesday.  
####   
#### For the numbers ending in '-teen', that becomes:  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### So there are seven numbers ending in '-teen'.  
#### And there are also seven weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).  
#### Therefore, it is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one numbered day ending with "teen" each month.  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953 (or, alternately the "Saturteenth" of August, 1953), we need to look at the calendar for August 1953:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### The Saturday that has a number ending in '-teen' is August 15, 1953.

#### ## Customizing and Raising Exceptions  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.  
####   
#### Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).  
####   
#### For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.  
####   
#### To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException  
#### class MeetupDayException(ValueError):  
####     """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.  
####   
####     message: explanation of the error.  
####   
####     """  
####     def __init__(self, message):  
####         self.message = message  
####   
####           
#### # raising a MeetupDayException  
#### raise MeetupDayException("That day does not exist.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `meetup` function, we need to use the `calendar` module from Python's standard library. This module provides various functions to work with dates and can help us find the exact date of the meetup.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Import the `calendar` module.
2. Map the `week` and `day_of_week` parameters to their corresponding numerical values. For example, 'first' corresponds to 1, 'second' corresponds to 2, and so on. Similarly, 'Monday' corresponds to 0, 'Tuesday' corresponds to 1, and so on.
3. Use the `monthcalendar` function from the `calendar` module to get a matrix representing a monthâ€™s calendar. Each row represents a week and days outside of the month a set to 0.
4. Iterate over the matrix to find the exact date of the meetup based on the `week` and `day_of_week` parameters.
5. If the `week` parameter is 'teenth', then we need to find the day of the week that falls between the 13th and 19th of the month.
6. If the `week` parameter is 'last', then we need to find the last occurrence of the day of the week in the month.
7. If the `week` parameter is 'first', 'second', 'third', or 'fourth', then we need to find the corresponding occurrence of the day of the week in the month.
8. If the `week` and `day_of_week` parameters do not result in a valid date, raise a `MeetupDayException` with a meaningful error message.

Here is the updated `meetup.py` file:

meetup.py
```
import calendar

# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    weeks = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'last', 'teenth']
    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

    if week not in weeks or day_of_week not in days:
        raise MeetupDayException("Invalid week or day_of_week parameter.")

    week_index = weeks.index(week)
    day_index = days.index(day_of_week)

    month_calendar = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)

    if week == 'teenth':
        for i in range(1, len(month_calendar)):
            if 13 <= month_calendar[i][day_index] <= 19:
                return year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index]
    elif week == 'last':
        for i in range(len(month_calendar) - 1, -1, -1):
            if month_calendar[i][day_index] != 0:
                return year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index]
    else:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(month_calendar)):
            if month_calendar[i][day_index] != 0:
                count += 1
                if count == week_index + 1:
                    return year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index]

    raise MeetupDayException("The Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.")
```
This function will return a tuple containing the year, month, and day of the meetup. If the `week` and `day_of_week` parameters do not result in a valid date, it will raise a `MeetupDayException` with a meaningful error message.

> 1630 prompt tokens, 472 completion tokens, $0.077220 cost  

The errors and failures in the tests are due to two main issues:

1. The function `meetup` does not handle the "fifth" week. This is causing the `MeetupDayException` in the first three test cases. We need to add a condition to handle this case.

2. The function `meetup` returns a tuple `(year, month, day)` instead of a `datetime.date` object. This is causing the `AssertionError` in the last two test cases. We need to change the return type to `datetime.date`.

Here is the updated code:

meetup.py
```
import calendar
from datetime import date

class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    weeks = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'last', 'teenth']
    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

    if week not in weeks or day_of_week not in days:
        raise MeetupDayException("Invalid week or day_of_week parameter.")

    week_index = weeks.index(week)
    day_index = days.index(day_of_week)

    month_calendar = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)

    if week == 'teenth':
        for i in range(1, len(month_calendar)):
            if 13 <= month_calendar[i][day_index] <= 19:
                return date(year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index])
    elif week == 'last':
        for i in range(len(month_calendar) - 1, -1, -1):
            if month_calendar[i][day_index] != 0:
                return date(year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index])
    else:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(month_calendar)):
            if month_calendar[i][day_index] != 0:
                count += 1
                if count == week_index + 1:
                    return date(year, month, month_calendar[i][day_index])

    raise MeetupDayException("The Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.")
```
This updated code should pass all the tests.
