#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.  
####   
#### Your team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.  
#### That can cause all sorts of havoc.  
####   
#### But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.  
####   
#### This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.  
####   
#### Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).  
####   
#### Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:  
####   
#### - `G` -> `C`  
#### - `C` -> `G`  
#### - `T` -> `A`  
#### - `A` -> `U`  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### If you want to look at how the inputs and outputs are structured, take a look at the examples in the test suite.  
#### ~~~~

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rna_transcription.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `to_rna` function in the `rna_transcription.py` file. This function should take a DNA strand as input and return its RNA complement. 

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Create a dictionary to map each DNA nucleotide to its RNA complement.
2. Use a list comprehension to replace each nucleotide in the DNA strand with its RNA complement.
3. Join the list of RNA nucleotides into a string and return it.

Here's the updated `rna_transcription.py` file:

rna_transcription.py
```
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    dna_to_rna = {'G': 'C', 'C': 'G', 'T': 'A', 'A': 'U'}
    return ''.join([dna_to_rna[nucleotide] for nucleotide in dna_strand])
```
