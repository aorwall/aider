To implement the song lyrics, we can use a loop that starts from the 'start' parameter and ends at 1. In each iteration, we will generate the four lines of the song. The 'take' parameter can be used to determine how many verses to generate.

Here is the updated code:

bottle_song.py
```
def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, start - take, -1):
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
        if i - 1 == 0:
            lyrics.append("There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.")
        else:
            lyrics.append(f"There'll be {i - 1} green bottles hanging on the wall.")
    return '\n'.join(lyrics)
```
This function will return the lyrics of the song as a string. The number of verses is determined by the 'take' parameter. If 'take' is not provided, it defaults to 1, meaning only one verse will be generated.

The test failures indicate that the function `recite` in `bottle_song.py` is not correctly handling the conversion of numbers to their word equivalents. The function is currently returning the numeric value (e.g., "10", "1") instead of the word equivalent (e.g., "Ten", "One"). 

To fix this, we need to add a function that converts numbers to their word equivalents and use this function when generating the lyrics.

Here is the updated `bottle_song.py`:

bottle_song.py
```
def number_to_word(n):
    words = {
        1: 'One',
        2: 'Two',
        3: 'Three',
        4: 'Four',
        5: 'Five',
        6: 'Six',
        7: 'Seven',
        8: 'Eight',
        9: 'Nine',
        10: 'Ten'
    }
    return words[n]

def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, start - take, -1):
        word = number_to_word(i)
        lyrics.append(f"{word} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"{word} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
        if i - 1 == 0:
            lyrics.append("There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.")
        else:
            word = number_to_word(i - 1)
            lyrics.append(f"There'll be {word.lower()} green bottles hanging on the wall.")
    return '\n'.join(lyrics)
```
This updated code includes a `number_to_word` function that converts numbers to their word equivalents. This function is then used in the `recite` function to generate the lyrics with the correct word equivalents for the numbers.
