#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.  
####   
#### An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.  
####   
#### Examples of isograms:  
####   
#### - lumberjacks  
#### - background  
#### - downstream  
#### - six-year-old  
####   
#### The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to modify the `is_isogram` function in the `isogram.py` file to check if a word or phrase is an isogram. We can achieve this by converting the string to lowercase, removing spaces and hyphens, and then checking if the length of the set of characters is equal to the length of the string. If they are equal, it means all characters are unique and the string is an isogram.

Here is the updated `isogram.py` file:

isogram.py
```
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('-', '')
    return len(string) == len(set(string))
```
This function works by first converting the string to lowercase and removing spaces and hyphens. Then it checks if the length of the string is equal to the length of the set of characters in the string. A set in Python is a collection of unique elements, so if the lengths are equal, it means all characters in the string are unique and the string is an isogram.
