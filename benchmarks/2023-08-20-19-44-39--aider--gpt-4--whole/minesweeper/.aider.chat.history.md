#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.  
####   
#### Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.  
####   
#### In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.  
####   
#### The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.  
#### A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.  
####   
#### If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ·*·*·  
#### ··*··  
#### ··*··  
#### ·····  
#### ```  
####   
#### And your code will transform it into this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 1*3*1  
#### 13*31  
#### ·2*2·  
#### ·111·  
#### ```

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()` function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the board receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: minesweeper.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Minesweeper board, we need to iterate over each cell in the board. If the cell is not a mine, we count the number of mines in the adjacent cells and replace the cell with the count. If the cell is a mine, we leave it as is. If the cell has no adjacent mines, we leave it blank.

Here is the updated code:

minesweeper.py
```
def annotate(minefield):
    # Check if minefield is empty
    if not minefield:
        return []

    # Initialize the result with the same size as minefield
    result = [list(row) for row in minefield]

    # Define the directions for adjacent cells
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Iterate over each cell in the minefield
    for i in range(len(minefield)):
        for j in range(len(minefield[0])):
            # If the cell is not a mine
            if minefield[i][j] != '*':
                # Count the number of mines in the adjacent cells
                mines = sum(minefield[i + dx][j + dy] == '*' for dx, dy in directions if 0 <= i + dx < len(minefield) and 0 <= j + dy < len(minefield[0]))
                # Replace the cell with the count if there are any mines, otherwise leave it blank
                result[i][j] = str(mines) if mines else ' '

    # Return the result as a list of strings
    return [''.join(row) for row in result]
```

This code assumes that the input `minefield` is a list of strings, where each string represents a row in the minefield. Each character in the string is either a blank space (' ') or a mine ('*'). The function returns a list of strings, where each string represents a row in the annotated minefield. Each character in the string is either a blank space (' '), a mine ('*'), or a digit representing the number of mines in the adjacent cells.

The current code does not handle the cases where the input is invalid. Specifically, it does not raise a ValueError when the input board has rows of different lengths or contains invalid characters. 

To fix this, we need to add checks at the beginning of the function to validate the input. If the input is invalid, we should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

Here is the updated code:

minesweeper.py
```python
def annotate(minefield):
    # Check if minefield is empty
    if not minefield:
        return []

    # Check if all rows have the same length
    if len(set(len(row) for row in minefield)) > 1:
        raise ValueError("All rows must have the same length.")

    # Check if minefield contains only valid characters
    if any(char not in ' *' for row in minefield for char in row):
        raise ValueError("Minefield can only contain spaces and asterisks.")

    # Initialize the result with the same size as minefield
    result = [list(row) for row in minefield]

    # Define the directions for adjacent cells
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Iterate over each cell in the minefield
    for i in range(len(minefield)):
        for j in range(len(minefield[0])):
            # If the cell is not a mine
            if minefield[i][j] != '*':
                # Count the number of mines in the adjacent cells
                mines = sum(minefield[i + dx][j + dy] == '*' for dx, dy in directions if 0 <= i + dx < len(minefield) and 0 <= j + dy < len(minefield[0]))
                # Replace the cell with the count if there are any mines, otherwise leave it blank
                result[i][j] = str(mines) if mines else ' '

    # Return the result as a list of strings
    return [''.join(row) for row in result]
```
This updated code should now pass all the tests.
