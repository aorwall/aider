#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An [Armstrong number][armstrong-number] is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`  
#### - 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`  
#### - 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`  
#### - 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`  
####   
#### Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: armstrong_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Armstrong number check, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
2. Calculate the power as the length of this string.
3. For each digit, convert it back to an integer, raise it to the power, and add it to a sum.
4. Finally, compare this sum to the original number.

Here is the updated code:

armstrong_numbers.py
```
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    str_number = str(number)
    power = len(str_number)
    sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) ** power for digit in str_number)
    return sum_of_digits == number
```
This function will now correctly identify Armstrong numbers.
