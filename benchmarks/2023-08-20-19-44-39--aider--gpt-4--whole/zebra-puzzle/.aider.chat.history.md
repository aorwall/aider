The zebra puzzle is a well-known logic puzzle. It can be solved by using a process of elimination and logical deduction. 

To solve this puzzle in Python, we can use a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a house. We can then iterate over the list to assign the properties to the houses according to the rules. 

Here is the updated code:

zebra_puzzle.py
```
def zebra_puzzle():
    houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    orderings = list(itertools.permutations(houses)) # 1
    return next((WATER, ZEBRA)
                for (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue) in orderings
                if imright(h1=ivory, h2=green) # 6
                for (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Japanese, Norwegian) in orderings
                if Englishman is red # 2
                if Norwegian is 1 # 10
                if nextto(h1=Norwegian, h2=blue) # 15
                for (coffee, tea, milk, oj, WATER) in orderings
                if coffee is green # 4
                if Ukrainian is tea # 5
                if milk is 3 # 9
                for (OldGold, Kools, Chesterfields, LuckyStrike, Parliaments) in orderings
                if Kools is yellow # 8
                if LuckyStrike is oj # 13
                if Japanese is Parliaments # 14
                for (dog, snails, fox, horse, ZEBRA) in orderings
                if Spaniard is dog # 3
                if OldGold is snails # 7
                if nextto(h1=Chesterfields, h2=fox) # 11
                if nextto(h1=Kools, h2=horse) # 12
                )

def imright(h1, h2):
    "House h1 is immediately right of h2 if h1-h2 == 1."
    return h1-h2 == 1

def nextto(h1, h2):
    "Two houses are next to each other if they differ by 1."
    return abs(h1-h2) == 1

def drinks_water():
    _, water = zebra_puzzle()
    return "The resident of house number {} drinks water.".format(water)

def owns_zebra():
    zebra, _ = zebra_puzzle()
    return "The resident of house number {} owns the zebra.".format(zebra)
```

In the `zebra_puzzle` function, we generate all possible permutations of the houses and then use a generator expression to find the first permutation that satisfies all the conditions. The `imright` and `nextto` functions are helper functions that check if one house is immediately to the right of another or if two houses are next to each other, respectively.

The `drinks_water` and `owns_zebra` functions call the `zebra_puzzle` function and return the results in a human-readable format.

The error messages indicate two main issues:

1. The `itertools` module is not imported, which is causing a `NameError` when the code tries to use `itertools.permutations`.
2. The `is` keyword is used for literal comparison, which is not recommended and can cause unexpected behavior. The `==` operator should be used for comparing values.

Here is the corrected code:

zebra_puzzle.py
```
