#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a² + b² = c²  
#### ```  
####   
#### and such that,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a < b < c  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 3² + 4² = 5².  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.  
####   
#### For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### *NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pythagorean_triplet.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the function `triplets_with_sum(number)`, we need to find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = number`. We can do this by using three nested loops. The outer loop will iterate over possible values for `a`, the middle loop will iterate over possible values for `b`, and the inner loop will iterate over possible values for `c`. For each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we will check if `a + b + c = number` and `a² + b² = c²`. If both conditions are true, we will add the triplet `[a, b, c]` to our list of results.

Here is the updated code:

pythagorean_triplet.py
```
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    triplets = []
    for a in range(1, number):
        for b in range(a, number):
            c = number - a - b
            if a*a + b*b == c*c:
                triplets.append([a, b, c])
    return triplets
```
This function will return a list of lists, where each inner list is a Pythagorean triplet. The order of the triplets in the outer list does not matter, as specified in the instructions.
