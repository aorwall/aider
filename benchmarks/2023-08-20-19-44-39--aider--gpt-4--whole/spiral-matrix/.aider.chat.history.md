#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.  
####   
#### The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1 in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order, like these examples:  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### ### Spiral matrix of size 3  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 1 2 3  
#### 8 9 4  
#### 7 6 5  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Spiral matrix of size 4  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  2  3 4  
#### 12 13 14 5  
#### 11 16 15 6  
#### 10  9  8 7  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: spiral_matrix.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the spiral matrix, we will need to create a 2D array of the given size and fill it in a spiral order. We can do this by keeping track of the current row and column, and the current direction of movement. We start from the top left corner and move right until we reach the end of the row or a cell that has already been filled. Then we move down until we reach the end of the column or a cell that has already been filled. We continue this process, changing direction from right to down to left to up, until all cells have been filled.

Here is the updated code:

spiral_matrix.py
```
def spiral_matrix(size):
    # Initialize the matrix with zeros
    matrix = [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]
    
    # Initialize the directions of movement
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Initialize the current direction, row, and column
    direction = 0
    row = 0
    col = 0
    
    for i in range(1, size*size + 1):
        # Fill the current cell
        matrix[row][col] = i
        
        # Calculate the next row and column
        next_row = row + directions[direction][0]
        next_col = col + directions[direction][1]
        
        # If the next cell is within the matrix and has not been filled yet, move to it
        if 0 <= next_row < size and 0 <= next_col < size and matrix[next_row][next_col] == 0:
            row = next_row
            col = next_col
        else:
            # Otherwise, change direction and move to the next cell in the new direction
            direction = (direction + 1) % 4
            row += directions[direction][0]
            col += directions[direction][1]
    
    return matrix
```
This function will return a 2D list of integers representing the spiral matrix of the given size.
