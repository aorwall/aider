#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) * $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) * $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book_store.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we need to implement the `total` function in the `book_store.py` file. This function should take a list of books as input and return the total cost after applying the maximum possible discount.

Here is the updated `book_store.py` file:

book_store.py
```
def total(basket):
    discounts = [0, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25]
    total = 0
    while len(basket) > 0:
        unique_books = set(basket)
        discount = discounts[len(unique_books)]
        total += len(unique_books) * 8 * (1 - discount)
        for book in unique_books:
            basket.remove(book)
    return total
```

In this function, we first define the discounts for different numbers of unique books. Then we calculate the total cost in a loop until the basket is empty. In each iteration, we find the unique books in the basket and calculate the cost after applying the discount. We then remove one copy of each unique book from the basket. The loop continues until there are no more books in the basket.

The issue here is that the test cases are expecting the total price in cents, while the current implementation of the `total` function in `book_store.py` is returning the total price in dollars. 

To fix this, we need to update the `total` function to return the total price in cents. We can do this by multiplying the total price by 100 before returning it.

Here is the updated `book_store.py`:

book_store.py
```
def total(basket):
    discounts = [0, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25]
    total = 0
    while len(basket) > 0:
        unique_books = set(basket)
        discount = discounts[len(unique_books)]
        total += len(unique_books) * 8 * (1 - discount)
        for book in unique_books:
            basket.remove(book)
    return total * 100
```
This should resolve the errors and make the test cases pass.
