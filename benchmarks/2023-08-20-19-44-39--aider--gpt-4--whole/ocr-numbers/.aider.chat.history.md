#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is represented, or whether it is garbled.  
####   
#### ## Step One  
####   
#### To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.  
####   
#### The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns wide.  
####   
#### ```text  
####      _   #  
####     | |  # zero.  
####     |_|  #  
####          # the fourth row is always blank  
#### ```  
####   
#### Is converted to "0"  
####   
#### ```text  
####          #  
####       |  # one.  
####       |  #  
####          # (blank fourth row)  
#### ```  
####   
#### Is converted to "1"  
####   
#### If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should return '?'  
####   
#### If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.  
####   
#### ## Step Two  
####   
#### Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing garbled numbers with ?  
####   
#### ## Step Three  
####   
#### Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string.  
####   
#### ```text  
####  _  
####  _|  
#### |_  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Is converted to "2"  
####   
#### ```text  
####       _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #  
####     | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.  
####     ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #  
####                                  # fourth line is always blank  
#### ```  
####   
#### Is converted to "1234567890"  
####   
#### ## Step Four  
####   
#### Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line.  
#### When converting several lines, join the lines with commas.  
####   
#### ```text  
####     _  _  
####   | _| _|  
####   ||_  _|  
####   
####     _  _  
#### |_||_ |_  
####   | _||_|  
####   
####  _  _  _  
####   ||_||_|  
####   ||_| _|  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Is converted to "123,456,789".

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `convert()` function receives a string that isn't a valid OCR number. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the rows aren't multiples of 4  
#### raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")  
####   
#### # when the columns aren't multiples of 3  
#### raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: ocr_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The instructions provided require the implementation of the `convert` function in the `ocr_numbers.py` file. This function should take a 3x4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, and determine which number is represented, or whether it is garbled. 

The function should be able to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string. If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, the function should return '?'. If the input is the incorrect size, the function should raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful error message.

Here is the updated `ocr_numbers.py` file:

ocr_numbers.py
```
def convert(input_grid):
    if len(input_grid) % 4 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of input lines is not a multiple of four")
    if any(len(row) % 3 != 0 for row in input_grid):
        raise ValueError("Number of input columns is not a multiple of three")

    numbers = {
        " _ \n| |\n|_|\n   ": "0",
        "   \n  |\n  |\n   ": "1",
        " _ \n _|\n|_ \n   ": "2",
        " _ \n _|\n _|\n   ": "3",
        "   \n|_|\n  |\n   ": "4",
        " _ \n|_ \n _|\n   ": "5",
        " _ \n|_ \n|_|\n   ": "6",
        " _ \n  |\n  |\n   ": "7",
        " _ \n|_|\n|_|\n   ": "8",
        " _ \n|_|\n _|\n   ": "9",
    }

    result = ""
    for i in range(0, len(input_grid), 4):
        for j in range(0, len(input_grid[i]), 3):
            segment = "\n".join(row[j:j+3] for row in input_grid[i:i+4])
            result += numbers.get(segment, "?")
        result += ","
    return result.rstrip(",")
```
This function first checks if the input grid is of the correct size. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then it defines a dictionary `numbers` where each key is a string representation of a number and each value is the corresponding digit. It then iterates over the input grid, extracting each 3x4 segment and converting it to a number using the `numbers` dictionary. If a segment cannot be recognized, it is converted to '?'. The function finally returns the converted numbers as a string, with each number separated by a comma.
