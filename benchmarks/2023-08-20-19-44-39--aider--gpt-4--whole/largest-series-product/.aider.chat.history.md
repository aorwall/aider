#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a government agency that has intercepted a series of encrypted communication signals from a group of bank robbers.  
#### The signals contain a long sequence of digits.  
#### Your team needs to use various digital signal processing techniques to analyze the signals and identify any patterns that may indicate the planning of a heist.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to look for patterns in the long sequence of digits in the encrypted signal.  
####   
#### The technique you're going to use here is called the largest series product.  
####   
#### Let's define a few terms, first.  
####   
#### - **input**: the sequence of digits that you need to analyze  
#### - **series**: a sequence of adjacent digits (those that are next to each other) that is contained within the input  
#### - **span**: how many digits long each series is  
#### - **product**: what you get when you multiply numbers together  
####   
#### Let's work through an example, with the input `"63915"`.  
####   
#### - To form a series, take adjacent digits in the original input.  
#### - If you are working with a span of `3`, there will be three possible series:  
####   - `"639"`  
####   - `"391"`  
####   - `"915"`  
#### - Then we need to calculate the product of each series:  
####   - The product of the series `"639"` is 162 (`6 × 3 × 9 = 162`)  
####   - The product of the series `"391"` is 27 (`3 × 9 × 1 = 27`)  
####   - The product of the series `"915"` is 45 (`9 × 1 × 5 = 45`)  
#### - 162 is bigger than both 27 and 45, so the largest series product of `"63915"` is from the series `"639"`.  
####   So the answer is **162**.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when your `largest_product()` function receives invalid input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  Feel free to reuse your code from the `series` exercise!  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # span of numbers is longer than number series  
#### raise ValueError("span must be smaller than string length")  
####   
#### # span of number is negative  
#### raise ValueError("span must not be negative")  
####   
#### # series includes non-number input  
#### raise ValueError("digits input must only contain digits")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: largest_series_product.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `largest_product()` function, we need to:

1. Check if the input series is valid. It should only contain digits and the span should be non-negative and not greater than the length of the series. If any of these conditions are not met, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
2. If the span is zero, we return 1 as the product of an empty list is 1.
3. If the span is not zero, we calculate the product of all possible spans in the series and return the maximum product.

Here is the updated `largest_series_product.py`:

largest_series_product.py
```
def largest_product(series, size):
    if not series.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("digits input must only contain digits")
    if size > len(series) or size < 0:
        raise ValueError("span must be smaller than string length and non-negative")
    if size == 0:
        return 1
    return max(product_of_digits(series[i:i+size]) for i in range(len(series) - size + 1))

def product_of_digits(digits):
    product = 1
    for digit in digits:
        product *= int(digit)
    return product
```

In this code, `product_of_digits()` is a helper function that calculates the product of all digits in a string. The `largest_product()` function uses this helper function to calculate the product of all possible spans in the series and returns the maximum product.

The error messages in the tests are not matching the error messages in the code. The error messages in the code are more descriptive and accurate, but the tests are expecting specific error messages. 

To fix this, we need to update the error messages in the code to match the ones expected by the tests.

Here is the updated code:

largest_series_product.py
```
def largest_product(series, size):
    if not series.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("digits input must only contain digits")
    if size > len(series):
        raise ValueError("span must be smaller than string length")
    if size < 0:
        raise ValueError("span must not be negative")
    if size == 0:
        return 1
    return max(product_of_digits(series[i:i+size]) for i in range(len(series) - size + 1))

def product_of_digits(digits):
    product = 1
    for digit in digits:
        product *= int(digit)
    return product
```
