#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.  
####   
#### A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or  
#### copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are  
#### vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect  
#### throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very  
#### rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,  
#### the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated  
#### result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.  
####   
#### The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point  
#### mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.  
####   
#### By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands  
#### taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of  
#### the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the  
#### evolutionary path between the two strands.  
####   
#### This is called the 'Hamming distance'

#### The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.  
####   
#### ## Implementation notes  
####   
#### The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you  
#### may assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming  
#### distance function.  
####   
#### **Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: point_mutations.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The instructions provided indicate that we need to implement the `hamming_distance` function in the `point_mutations.py` file. This function should calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands, which is the number of point mutations (differences) between the two strands. 

The function should only accept sequences of equal length, and the Hamming distance is calculated by comparing each nucleotide in the two strands and incrementing a counter each time the nucleotides at the same position in the two strands are different.

Here is the updated `point_mutations.py` file:

point_mutations.py
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("DNA strands must be of equal length")
    
    return sum(nucleotide_1 != nucleotide_2 for nucleotide_1, nucleotide_2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2))
```

In this updated function, we first check if the lengths of the two DNA strands are equal. If they are not, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. 

Then, we use the `zip` function to iterate over the two DNA strands simultaneously, comparing each pair of nucleotides. The `zip` function returns a tuple of corresponding elements from each input iterable, which allows us to compare the nucleotides at the same position in the two strands.

The expression `nucleotide_1 != nucleotide_2` returns `True` if the nucleotides are different and `False` otherwise. Since `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python, we can use the `sum` function to count the number of differences between the two strands, which is the Hamming distance.

The current implementation of the `hamming_distance` function in `point_mutations.py` raises a `ValueError` when the two input DNA strands are not of equal length. However, the test cases provided seem to expect the function to ignore extra length on either strand when comparing them. 

To fix this, we can modify the `hamming_distance` function to only compare the nucleotides up to the length of the shorter strand. This can be done by replacing the `zip` function with `itertools.zip_longest` and providing a fillvalue that will not match any nucleotide. This way, any extra nucleotides in the longer strand will not contribute to the Hamming distance.

Here is the updated `point_mutations.py`:

```python
import itertools

def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    return sum(nucleotide_1 != nucleotide_2 for nucleotide_1, nucleotide_2 in itertools.zip_longest(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2, fillvalue=None))
```

This version of the function will not raise a `ValueError` for strands of unequal length, and should pass all the provided test cases.
