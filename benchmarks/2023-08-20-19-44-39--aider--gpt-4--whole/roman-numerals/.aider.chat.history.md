#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.  
####   
#### The Romans were a clever bunch.  
#### They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  
#### They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.  
#### One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.  
#### This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
#### For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.  
####   
#### The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
#### (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  => I  
#### 10  => X  
####  7  => VII  
#### ```  
####   
#### The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.  
#### (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)  
####   
#### Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.  
####   
#### To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.  
####   
#### In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:  
####   
#### 1000=M  
#### 900=CM  
#### 90=XC  
####   
#### 2008 is written as MMVIII:  
####   
#### 2000=MM  
#### 8=VIII  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the conversion from normal numbers to Roman Numerals, we need to create a mapping of the Roman numerals to their corresponding values. Then, we will iterate through this mapping, subtracting the current value from the number as many times as possible and appending the corresponding Roman numeral to the result for each subtraction. 

Here is the updated code:

roman_numerals.py
```
def roman(number):
    numeral_map = {1: "I", 4: "IV", 5: "V", 9: "IX", 10: "X", 40: "XL", 50: "L", 90: "XC", 100: "C", 400: "CD", 500: "D", 900: "CM", 1000: "M"}
    result = ""
    for value, numeral in sorted(numeral_map.items(), reverse=True):
        while number >= value:
            result += numeral
            number -= value
    return result
```
This function will convert a number to its Roman numeral representation. The numeral_map dictionary contains the Roman numerals as keys and their corresponding values as values. The sorted() function is used to sort the dictionary items in reverse order, so that we start with the largest value. The while loop subtracts the current value from the number as many times as possible and appends the corresponding Roman numeral to the result for each subtraction. The function returns the resulting Roman numeral string.
