Here is an implementation of the `best_hands` function using standard Python libraries. This solution uses a dictionary to map each card value to its corresponding numerical score, then iterates through the cards in each hand to calculate their respective scores. The hand with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the hand with more higher cards wins. If both have same high cards then it's a tie.

The `card_value` function calculates the score of a single card. The `hand_score` function calculates the score of a whole hand.

```python
def best_hands(hands):
    suits = {'S': 0, 'H': 1, 'D': 2, 'C': 3}
    values = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}
    
    def card_value(card):
        return (values[card[0]] * 4) + suits[card[1]]
    
    def hand_score(hand):
        return sum(card_value(card) for card in hand)
    
    hands_with_scores = [(hand, hand_score(hand)) for hand in hands]
    max_score = max(hand[1] for hand in hands_with_scores)
    winners = [hand for hand, score in hands_with_scores if score == max_score]
    
    return winners
```

This implementation assumes that the input is a list of strings representing poker hands, where each string represents one hand and consists of five cards represented as two-character strings, with the first character being the value of the card and the second character being the suit. For example: `['2H', '3D', '5S', '9C', 'KD']`.
