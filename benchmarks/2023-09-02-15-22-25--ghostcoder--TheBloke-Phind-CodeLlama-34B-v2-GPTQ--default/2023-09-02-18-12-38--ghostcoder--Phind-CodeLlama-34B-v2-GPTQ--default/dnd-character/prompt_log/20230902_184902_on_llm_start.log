# Instructions

For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.
These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.
You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.
You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.
You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:

- 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
- 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
- 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
- 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
- 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
- 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.

Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

## Notes

Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.
One such language is [Troll][troll].

Here is an updated version of `dnd_character.py` that follows the rules for generating a D&D character:
Filepath: dnd_character.py
```
import random
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self._abilities = {
            'strength': self._roll(),
            'dexterity': self._roll(),
            'constitution': self._roll(),
            'intelligence': self._roll(),
            'wisdom': self._roll(),
            'charisma': self._roll()
        }

        self.hitpoints = 10 + self._calc_modifier(self._abilities['constitution'])

    @staticmethod
    def _roll():
        return sum(sorted([random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)])[-3:])

    @staticmethod
    def _calc_modifier(score):
        return (score - 10) // 2

```

In this code, we have added methods to handle rolling dice and calculating ability scores and hit points. The `_roll()` method rolls four six-sided dice, discards the lowest result, and returns the sum of the remaining three. This process is repeated five more times in the `__init__()` method to generate all six abilities. Then, it calculates the constitution modifier using the `_calc_modifier()` method, which simply subtracts 10 from the constitution score, divides by two, and rounds down. Finally, it assigns the calculated hit point total to the `hitpoints` attribute.
