# Instructions

To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.

One copy of any of the five books costs $8.

If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.

If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.

Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.

Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.

For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

- 2 copies of the first book
- 2 copies of the second book
- 2 copies of the third book
- 1 copy of the fourth book
- 1 copy of the fifth book

One way of grouping these 8 books is:

- 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)
- 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

This would give a total of:

- 5 books at a 25% discount
- 3 books at a 10% discount

Resulting in:

- 5 × (100% - 25%) * $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus
- 3 × (100% - 10%) * $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60

Which equals $51.60.

However, a different way to group these 8 books is:

- 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)

This would give a total of:

- 4 books at a 20% discount
- 4 books at a 20% discount

Resulting in:

- 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus
- 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60

Which equals $51.20.

And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.

Here is an updated version of `book_store.py` that calculates the total cost of a basket of books according to the rules specified:
Filepath: book_store.py
```
def calculate_discount(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 0.05
    elif n == 3:
        return 0.10
    elif n == 4:
        return 0.20
    else:
        return 0.25
def total(basket):
    # Initialize total price as zero
    total_price = 0

    # Count number of different books in the basket
    unique_books = len(set(basket))

    # Group books by their counts
    grouped_books = {}
    for book in basket:
        if book in grouped_books:
            grouped_books[book] += 1
        else:
            grouped_books[book] = 1

    # Calculate total price based on group sizes and apply discounts
    for count in grouped_books.values():
        total_price += (calculate_discount(unique_books) * count + unique_books - 1) * 8 / unique_books

    return round(total_price, 2)

```

This code first determines the applicable discount based on the number of unique books in the basket. It then groups the books by their counts and calculates the total cost using the formula described in the instructions. The result is rounded to two decimal places before being returned.

    return round(total_price, 2)

```
