To fix the issue with the tests, we need to make sure that our `is_isogram` function returns `True`, `False` or the result of a comparison, instead of just a truthy value (`1`) or a falsy one (`0`). We can do this by returning the result of comparing the lengths of the string and its set transformation directly. Here's how I would update the function:
Filepath: isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '')
    string = string.replace('-', '')

    return len(string) == len(set(string))
```
