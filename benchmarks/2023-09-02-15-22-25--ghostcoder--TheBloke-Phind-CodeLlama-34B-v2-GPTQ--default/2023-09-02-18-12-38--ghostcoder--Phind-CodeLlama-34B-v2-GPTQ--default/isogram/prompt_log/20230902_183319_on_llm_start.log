# Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's how I would update `isogram.py`:
Filepath: isogram.py
```
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '')
    string = string.replace('-', '')

    return len(string) == len(set(string))

```

This function works by first removing all spaces and hyphens from the input string using the `replace` method. Then it checks whether the length of the resulting string equals the length of its unique characters (i.e., no character appears more than once). This is done by converting the string to a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and comparing the lengths of both. If they are equal, then every character in the string was unique, so the string is an isogram. Otherwise, there were some repeated characters, so the string isn't an isogram.

### User Message
Filepath: isogram.py
```pyton
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '')
    string = string.replace('-', '')

    return len(string) == len(set(string))

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in isogram.py to resolve the errors.
