# Introduction

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
Like the previous `Resistor Color Duo` and `Resistor Color Trio` exercises, you will be translating resistor color bands to human-readable labels.

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
- Each band acts as a digit of a number.
  For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.
# Instructions

In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.
The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.
The color bands are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.
For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.
In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.
Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.
For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.

The tolerance band will have one of these values:

- Grey - 0.05%
- Violet - 0.1%
- Blue - 0.25%
- Green - 0.5%
- Brown - 1%
- Red - 2%
- Gold - 5%
- Silver - 10%

The four-band resistor is built up like this:

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.

The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Value_3 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-orange-black-green would be 333 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-red-orange-blue-violet would be 323M ohms with a ±0.10 tolerance.

There are also one band resistors.
One band resistors only have the color black with a value of 0.

This exercise is about translating the resistor band colors into a label:

"... ohms ...%"

So an input of "orange", "orange", "black, green" should return:

"33 ohms ±0.5%"

When there are more than a thousand ohms, we say "kiloohms".
 That's similar to saying "kilometer" for 1000 meters, and "kilograms" for 1000 grams.

So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", grey should return:

"33 kiloohms ±0.05%"

When there are more than a million ohms, we say "megaohms".

So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", "red" should return:

"33 megaohms ±2%"

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_expert.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is how you can update `resistor_color_expert.py`:
Filepath: resistor_color_expert.py
```
def resistor_label(colors):
    color_codes = {
        'black': 0,
        'brown': 1,
        'red': 2,
        'orange': 3,
        'yellow': 4,
        'green': 5,
        'blue': 6,
        'violet': 7,
        'grey': 8,
        'white': 9
    }

    multiplier_codes = {
        'black': 1,
        'brown': 10,
        'red': 100,
        'orange': 1000,
        'yellow': 10000,
        'green': 100000,
        'blue': 1000000,
        'violet': 10000000,
        'grey': 100000000,
        'gold': 0.1,
        'silver': 0.01
    }

    value_1 = color_codes[colors[0]] * 10
    value_2 = color_codes[colors[1]]
    multiplier = multiplier_codes[colors[2]]
    tolerance = multiplier_codes[colors[3]] if len(colors) == 4 else None

    resistance = (value_1 + value_2) * multiplier

    unit = "ohms"
    if resistance >= 1000:
        resistance /= 1000
        unit = "kiloohms"
    elif resistance >= 1000000:
        resistance /= 1000000
        unit = "megaohms"

    label = f"{resistance} {unit}"
    if tolerance is not None:
        label += f" ±{tolerance}%"

    return label

```

This function first sets up dictionaries to map the colors to their corresponding values. Then it extracts `value_1`, `value_2`, `multiplier` and `tolerance` from the given colors. It calculates the resistance using these values, adjusting the unit of measurement accordingly. Finally, it generates a string representation for the resistor's label.
