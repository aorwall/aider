Here's an updated version of `make_mapping` function that resolves IndexError issue:
```python
def make_mapping(words, config):
    mapping = {}
    for word in words:
        for c in word:
            if c not in mapping:
                mapping[c] = config.pop(0) # Changed from config[len(mapping)]
    return mapping
```
This change is necessary because when we do `config[len(mapping)]`, it may go beyond the length of the list `config`. By using `config.pop(0)` instead, we always get the first element of the list and remove it, preventing this issue.
