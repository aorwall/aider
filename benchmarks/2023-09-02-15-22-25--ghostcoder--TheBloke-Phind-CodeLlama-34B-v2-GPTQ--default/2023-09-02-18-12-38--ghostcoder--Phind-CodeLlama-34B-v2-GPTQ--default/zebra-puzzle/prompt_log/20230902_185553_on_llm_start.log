    drinks = ['coffee', 'tea', 'milk', 'orange juice', 'water']
    cigarettes = ['old golds', 'kools', 'chesterfields', 'lucky strikes', 'parliaments']
    houses = [{'color': color, 'nationality': nation, 'pet': pet, 'drink': beverage, 'cigarette': cigarette} 
              for color, nation, pet, beverage, cigarette in zip(colors, nationalities, pets, drinks, cigarettes)]
