It seems that there is a TypeError in your function `maximum_value`. The error message indicates that a string object is being used where an integer is expected. This likely means that one of the weights or values provided is actually a string instead of an integer. To fix this issue, you can add type casting to ensure that both `wi` and `vi` are integers before using them. Here's the updated version of your function:

Filepath: knapsack.py
```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize a list with zeroes up to the maximum weight + 1
    dp = [0] * (maximum_weight + 1)

    # For each item
    for wi, vi in items:
        # Ensure both wi and vi are integers
        wi, vi = int(wi), int(vi)
        
        # For each possible weight from the item's weight down to zero
        for w in range(wi, -1, -1):
            # Update the maximum value obtainable with this item included
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[max(0, w - wi)] + vi)

    return dp[0]
```
This should resolve the TypeErrors you encountered during testing.
