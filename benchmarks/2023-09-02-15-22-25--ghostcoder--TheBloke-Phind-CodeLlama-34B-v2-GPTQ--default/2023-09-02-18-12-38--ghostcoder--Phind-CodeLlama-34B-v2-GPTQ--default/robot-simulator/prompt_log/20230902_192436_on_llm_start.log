# Instructions

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.
  Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is an updated version of your `robot_simulator.py` file that includes the necessary code for the robot movement simulation:
Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 0
NORTH = 1
WEST = 2
SOUTH = 3

TURN_RIGHT = ['S', 'W', 'N', 'E']
TURN_LEFT = ['E', 'N', 'W', 'S']
MOVE_FORWARD = ['E', 'N', 'W', 'S']


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def move(self, instruction):
        for cmd in instruction:
            if cmd == 'R':
                self.direction = TURN_RIGHT[self.direction]
            elif cmd == 'L':
                self.direction = TURN_LEFT[self.direction]
            elif cmd == 'A':
                if self.direction == NORTH:
                    self.y_pos += 1
                elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                    self.y_pos -= 1
                elif self.direction == EAST:
                    self.x_pos += 1
                else:
                    self.x_pos -= 1

        return (self.x_pos, self.y_pos)

```

This updated version of the `Robot` class includes a new method called `move()`, which takes in a string of instructions and updates the robot's position accordingly based on those instructions. The robot moves forward in the direction it is currently facing when it encounters an 'A'. It turns right when it encounters an 'R' and turns left when it encounters an 'L'.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_simulator.py to resolve the errors.
