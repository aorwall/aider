Here is an updated version of your `robot_simulator.py` file that includes the necessary code for the robot movement simulation:

```python
# Globals for the directions
EAST = 0
NORTH = 1
WEST = 2
SOUTH = 3

TURN_RIGHT = ['S', 'W', 'N', 'E']
TURN_LEFT = ['E', 'N', 'W', 'S']
MOVE_FORWARD = ['E', 'N', 'W', 'S']

class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def move(self, instruction):
        for cmd in instruction:
            if cmd == 'R':
                self.direction = TURN_RIGHT[self.direction]
            elif cmd == 'L':
                self.direction = TURN_LEFT[self.direction]
            elif cmd == 'A':
                if self.direction == NORTH:
                    self.y_pos += 1
                elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                    self.y_pos -= 1
                elif self.direction == EAST:
                    self.x_pos += 1
                else:
                    self.x_pos -= 1
        
        return (self.x_pos, self.y_pos)
```

This updated version of the `Robot` class includes a new method called `move()`, which takes in a string of instructions and updates the robot's position accordingly based on those instructions. The robot moves forward in the direction it is currently facing when it encounters an 'A'. It turns right when it encounters an 'R' and turns left when it encounters an 'L'.
