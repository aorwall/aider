To fix these issues, we need to make sure that our indexing does not go beyond the limits of our lists. We can do this by reducing the length of both `digits` and `base_three` by one before starting the loop. Here's how you can update the function in `trinary.py`:

Filepath: trinary.py
```python
def trinary(string):
    if not set(string).issubset('012'):
        return 0

    digits = [int(digit) for digit in string]
    base_three = [1, 3, 9]

    return sum([digits[i]*base_three[len(string)-i-2] for i in range(len(string)-1)])
```
Now let's run the tests again. The errors should be resolved.
