Here's how I would approach this problem. We can use concurrent.futures threading to achieve parallelism. Here's an implementation of `calculate` function:

```python
import collections
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def calculate(text_input):
    def count_letters(text):
        return dict(collections.Counter(text))
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(count_letters, text_input))
        
    final_result = results[0]
    for result in results[1:]:
        for key, value in result.items():
            if key in final_result:
                final_result[key] += value
            else:
                final_result[key] = value
                
    return final_result
```

This function uses Python's built-in `concurrent.futures` module which allows us to easily parallelize tasks. In this case, we are using `ThreadPoolExecutor()` to create a pool of worker threads that will process subtasks concurrently. 

The `count_letters` helper function is used to count letter frequencies within each individual string (or "subtask") and then all the results are combined together at the end. The combination step takes into account that some letters might not appear in every text input, so it adds up all the counts rather than just overwriting them.
