### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```

# Instructions

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains these 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text


   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text


+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text

  ++
  ++


```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of every line equals the length of the first line).

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rectangles.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is how you can update `rectangles.py` file to solve this problem:
Filepath: rectangles.py
```
def count_rectangles(diagram):
    rectangles = []
    lines = diagram.strip().split('
')
    height = len(lines)
    width = len(lines[0])

    for y in range(height - 1):
        for x in range(width - 1):
            if lines[y][x] == '+' and lines[y][x+1] == '+' and lines[y+1][x] == '+' and lines[y+1][x+1] == '+':
                rectangles.append((x, y))

    return len(rectangles), rectangles

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    diagram = "
".join([line.rstrip() for line in sys.stdin])
    print("Number of rectangles:", count_rectangles(diagram)[0])
```

This script reads an ASCII diagram from stdin, counts the number of rectangles in it using a similar algorithm as described in the instructions, then prints the result.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in rectangles.py to resolve the errors.
