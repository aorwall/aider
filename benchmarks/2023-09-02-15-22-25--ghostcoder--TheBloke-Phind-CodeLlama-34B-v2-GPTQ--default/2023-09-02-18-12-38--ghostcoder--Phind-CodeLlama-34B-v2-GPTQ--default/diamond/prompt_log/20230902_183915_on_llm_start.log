# Instructions

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.
Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is an updated version of your `diamond.py`:
Filepath: diamond.py
```
def rows(letter):
    alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    index = alphabet.index(letter)

    top_half = list(map(chr, range(65, 65+index)))[::-1]
    bottom_half = list(map(chr, range(65+index, 74)))

    lines = []
    max_width = len(" ".join(top_half))

    for i in range(len(top_half)):
        line = "".join((top_half[i], ) + tuple(' ' * (max_width - 2*len(top_half[i]))))
        if i < len(bottom_half):
            line += bottom_half[i]
        lines.append(line)

    return "
".join(lines)

```

This implementation creates a list of characters for the upper half of the diamond in reverse order and a list of characters for the lower half in ascending order. It then iterates over these lists, creating each row by joining the corresponding characters from both halves with appropriate number of spaces. The maximum width of the output is calculated as twice the length of the widest character in the first half.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in diamond.py to resolve the errors.
