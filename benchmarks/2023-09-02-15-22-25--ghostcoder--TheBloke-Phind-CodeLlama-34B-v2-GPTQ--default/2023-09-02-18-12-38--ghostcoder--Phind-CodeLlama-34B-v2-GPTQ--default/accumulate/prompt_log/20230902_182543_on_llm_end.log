Here is how you can solve it:

Filepath: accumulate.py
```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    return [operation(item) for item in collection]
```

This solution uses list comprehension to apply the operation function to every item in the collection. The result is a new list with the results of applying the operation function to each item in the original collection.
