# Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is an updated version of `robot_name.py` file:
Filepath: robot_name.py
```
import string
import random
class Robot:
    # Create a list of used names to avoid duplicates
    used_names = []
    def __init__(self):
        self._set_name()

    def _set_name(self):
        """Generate a random name for the robot."""
        while True:
            name = ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(2)] + 
                           [random.randint(0, 9) for _ in range(3)])
            if name not in self.__class__.used_names:
                self.__class__.used_names.append(name)
                self.name = name
                break

    def reset(self):
        """Reset the robot's name to a new randomly generated one."""
        self.__class__.used_names.remove(self.name)
        self._set_name()

```

In this code, I have added a `_set_name()` method which generates a random name for the robot following the given format. This method checks if the generated name already exists in `used_names`, and regenerates another one if it does. Once a unique name is found, it adds it to `used_names`.

The `reset()` method removes the current robot's name from `used_names` when called, so that when a new name is set in `_set_name()`, it won't conflict with the old name of this robot.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_name.py to resolve the errors.
