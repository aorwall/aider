### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```




### User Message
Filepath: matrix.py
```pyton
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        pass

    def row(self, index):
        pass

    def column(self, index):
        pass

```

# Instructions

Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.

So given a string with embedded newlines like:

```text
9 8 7
5 3 2
6 6 7
```

representing this matrix:

```text
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2
3 | 6  6  7
```

your code should be able to spit out:

- A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,
- A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.

The rows for our example matrix:

- 9, 8, 7
- 5, 3, 2
- 6, 6, 7

And its columns:

- 9, 5, 6
- 8, 3, 6
- 7, 2, 7
# Instructions append

In this exercise you're going to create a **class**.  _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think!_ 

-   [**A First Look at Classes**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes) from the Python 3 documentation. 
-   [**How to Define a Class in Python**](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#how-to-define-a-class-in-python) from the Real Python website.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matrix.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
