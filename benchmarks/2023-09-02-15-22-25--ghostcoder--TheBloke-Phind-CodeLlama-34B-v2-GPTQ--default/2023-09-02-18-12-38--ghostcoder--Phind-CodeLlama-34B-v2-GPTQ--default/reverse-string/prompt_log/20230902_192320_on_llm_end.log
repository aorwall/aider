Here is how I would modify the `reverse_string.py` file:

```python
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]
```

This modification uses Python's slice notation to create a reversed copy of the input string. The `[::-1]` means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1 which essentially reverses the string.
