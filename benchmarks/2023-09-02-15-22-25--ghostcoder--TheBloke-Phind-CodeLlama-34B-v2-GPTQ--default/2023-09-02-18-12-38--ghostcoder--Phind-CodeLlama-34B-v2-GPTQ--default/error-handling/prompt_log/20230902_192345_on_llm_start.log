# Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
# Hints

For the `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception` function, the `filelike_object`
will be an instance of a custom `FileLike` class defined in the test suite. This
class implements the following methods:
- `open` and `close`, for explicit opening and closing.
- `__enter__` and `__exit__`, for implicit opening and closing.
- `do_something`, which may or may not throw an `Exception`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: error_handling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's how I would update the provided code according to the given instructions:
Filepath: error_handling.py
```
class FileLike:
    def __init__(self):
        self._is_open = False

    def open(self):
        self._is_open = True

    def close(self):
        self._is_open = False

    def do_something(self):
        if self._is_open:
            raise Exception("An exception occurred.")

    def __enter__(self):
        self.open()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.close()
def handle_error_by_throwing_exception():
    try:
        1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Caught an error: {e}")


def handle_error_by_returning_none(input_data):
    try:
        return int(input_data)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Invalid input: {e}")
        return None


def handle_error_by_returning_tuple(input_data):
    try:
        return (int(input_data), "success")
    except ValueError as e:
        return (None, f"Invalid input: {e}")


def filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception(filelike_object):
    with filelike_object as f:
        try:
            f.do_something()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Caught an error: {e}")

```

In this code, I've implemented the `FileLike` class and its methods as instructed. The error handling functions use a try-except block to catch exceptions and either throw them or return a specific value when an error occurs. In the function `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception`, I used the with statement which implicitly calls the `__enter__` method on the object and ensures that the `__exit__` method is called regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in error_handling.py to resolve the errors.
