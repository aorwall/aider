Here's how you can update `difference_of_squares.py`:

```python
def square_of_sum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2 ** 2

def sum_of_squares(n):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(1, n+1))

def difference_of_squares(n):
    return square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
```

In this updated version of the file, I have implemented the three functions as described in the instructions. The `square_of_sum` function calculates the square of the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The `sum_of_squares` function calculates the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers by iterating over the range from 1 to n+1 and squaring each number. Finally, the `difference_of_squares` function returns the difference between the result of the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions.
