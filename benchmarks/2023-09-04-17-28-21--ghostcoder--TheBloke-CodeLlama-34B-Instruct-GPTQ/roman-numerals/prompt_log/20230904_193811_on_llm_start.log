# Instructions

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans were a clever bunch.
They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.
They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.
One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.
This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.
For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
(notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

```text
 1  => I
10  => X
 7  => VII
```

The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: roman_numerals.py
```python
def roman(number):

    # Create a dictionary to map numbers to Roman numerals

        10: 'X',
        50: 'L',
        100: 'C',
        500: 'D',
        1000: 'M'
    }

    # Initialize an empty string to store the Roman numeral
    roman_numeral = ''

    # Loop through the digits of the number
    while number > 0:
        # If the digit is 4, we need to represent it as V-I (5-1)
        if number % 10 == 4:
            roman_numeral += num_dict[5] + num_dict[1]
        # If the digit is 9, we need to represent it as X-I (10-1)
        elif number % 10 == 9:
            roman_numeral += num_dict[10] + num_dict[1]
        else:
            # Get the corresponding Roman numeral for the digit
            roman_numeral += num_dict[number % 10]

        # Move to the next digit
        number //= 10

    return roman_numeral
