You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

[Alphametics][alphametics] is a puzzle where letters in words are replaced with numbers.

For example `SEND + MORE = MONEY`:

```text
  S E N D
  M O R E +
-----------
M O N E Y
```

Replacing these with valid numbers gives:

```text
  9 5 6 7
  1 0 8 5 +
-----------
1 0 6 5 2
```

This is correct because every letter is replaced by a different number and the words, translated into numbers, then make a valid sum.

Each letter must represent a different digit, and the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero.

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: alphametics.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: alphametics.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: alphametics.py
```python
import re
from itertools import permutations

def solve(puzzle):
    # Extract the words from the puzzle
    words = re.findall('[A-Z]+', puzzle)

    # Get the unique letters in the puzzle
    letters = set(''.join(words))

    # Create a list of possible digits for each letter
    digits = []
    for letter in letters:
        digits.append([str(i) for i in range(10) if str(i) != letter])

    # Generate all possible combinations of digits for the letters
    possibilities = permutations(*digits)

    # Iterate over the possibilities and check if they satisfy the equation
    for possibility in possibilities:
        substitution = dict(zip(letters, possibility))

        # Check if the equation is satisfied
        left = eval(f"{substitution['S']} {substitution['E']} {substitution['N']} {substitution['D']}")
        right = eval(f"{substitution['M']} {substitution['O']} {substitution['R']} {substitution['E']}")
        if left + right == eval(f"{substitution['M']} {substitution['O']} {substitution['N']} {substitution['E']}"):
            return ' '.join(word.translate(str.maketrans(substitution)) for word in words)

    # If no solution was found, return None
    return None

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
