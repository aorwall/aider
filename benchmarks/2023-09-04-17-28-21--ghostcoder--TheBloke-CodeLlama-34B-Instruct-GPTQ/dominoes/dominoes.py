def can_chain(dominoes):
    """
    Returns whether the given sequence of dominoes can be arranged in a valid chain.
    
    A valid chain must satisfy the following conditions:
        1. There should be no gaps between the numbers on the dominoes. For example, [1|2], [3|4], [5|6].
        2. All numbers from 0 to 6 should be present exactly once each.
        3. The numbers on any two adjacent dominoes should match either horizontally or vertically.
           For example, [1|2] and [2|3] are adjacent and their right sides match.
    
    Parameters:
        dominoes - a sequence of dominoes represented as tuples of integers
    
    Returns:
        bool - whether the given sequence of dominoes can form a valid chain
