Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Convert a number, represented as a sequence of digits in one base, to any other base.

Implement general base conversion.
Given a number in base **a**, represented as a sequence of digits, convert it to base **b**.

## Note

- Try to implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About [Positional Notation][positional-notation]

In positional notation, a number in base **b** can be understood as a linear combination of powers of **b**.

The number 42, *in base 10*, means:

`(4 * 10^1) + (2 * 10^0)`

The number 101010, *in base 2*, means:

`(1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)`

The number 1120, *in base 3*, means:

`(1 * 3^3) + (1 * 3^2) + (2 * 3^1) + (0 * 3^0)`

I think you got the idea!

*Yes. Those three numbers above are exactly the same. Congratulations!*

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for different input and output bases. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a meaningful message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# for input.
raise ValueError("input base must be >= 2")

# another example for input.
raise ValueError("all digits must satisfy 0 <= d < input base")

# or, for output.
raise ValueError("output base must be >= 2")
```
