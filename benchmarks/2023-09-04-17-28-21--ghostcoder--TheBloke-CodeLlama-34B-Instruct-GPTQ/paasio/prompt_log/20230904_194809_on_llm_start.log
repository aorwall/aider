Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```
[/INST] Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Report network IO statistics.

You are writing a [PaaS][paas], and you need a way to bill customers based on network and filesystem usage.

Create a wrapper for network connections and files that can report IO statistics.
The wrapper must report:

- The total number of bytes read/written.
- The total number of read/write operations.

[paas]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: paasio.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: paasio.py
```python
import io
