You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.

Bob is a thief.
After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.

In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).
Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.
However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).

Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.
Note that Bob can take only one of each item.

All values given will be strictly positive.
Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.

For example:

Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]

Knapsack Limit: 10

For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.

In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.
He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: knapsack.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: knapsack.py
```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize variables
    max_val = 0
    current_weight = 0
    taken = [False] * len(items)

    # Sort items by value per weight ratio
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['value'] / x['weight'], reverse=True)

    # Loop through sorted items and check if they fit in the knapsack
    for i in range(len(sorted_items)):
        item = sorted_items[i]
        if current_weight + item['weight'] <= maximum_weight:
            # Add item to knapsack
            taken[i] = True
            max_val += item['value']
            current_weight += item['weight']

    # Return maximum value
    return max_val

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in knapsack.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: knapsack.py
```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize variables
    max_val = 0
    current_weight = 0
    taken = [False] * len(items)

    # Sort items by value per weight ratio
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['value'] / x['weight'], reverse=True)

    # Loop through sorted items and check if they fit in the knapsack
    for i in range(len(sorted_items)):
        item = sorted_items[i]
        if current_weight + item['weight'] <= maximum_weight:
            # Add item to knapsack
            taken[i] = True
            max_val += item['value']
            current_weight += item['weight']

    # Return maximum value
    return max_val
