Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

# Instructions

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched and nested correctly.
The string may also contain other characters, which for the purposes of this exercise should be ignored.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matching_brackets.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: matching_brackets.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: matching_brackets.py
```python
import re

def is_paired(input_string):
    # Remove non-bracket characters from input string
    clean_string = re.sub('[^(){}[]]+', '', input_string)

    # Initialize a stack to hold opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate through clean_string
    for char in clean_string:
        if char in ['(', '{', '[']:
            # Push opening brackets onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            # Pop closing brackets off the stack
            if len(stack) > 0:
                top = stack.pop()

                # Check if the popped character matches the current character
                if (top == '(' and char != ')') or \

                   (top == '[' and char != ']'):
                    return False

    # If the stack is empty after iterating through the entire string, then all brackets are paired properly

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in matching_brackets.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: matching_brackets.py
```python
import re

def is_paired(input_string):
    # Remove non-bracket characters from input string
    clean_string = re.sub('[^(){}[]]+', '', input_string)

    # Initialize a stack to hold opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate through clean_string
    for char in clean_string:
        if char in ['(', '{', '[']:
            # Push opening brackets onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            # Pop closing brackets off the stack
            if len(stack) > 0:
                top = stack.pop()

                # Check if the popped character matches the current character
                if (top == '(' and char != ')') or \
                   (top == '{' and char != '}') or \
                   (top == '[' and char != ']'):
                    return False

    # If the stack is empty after iterating through the entire string, then all brackets are paired properly
    return len(stack) == 0
