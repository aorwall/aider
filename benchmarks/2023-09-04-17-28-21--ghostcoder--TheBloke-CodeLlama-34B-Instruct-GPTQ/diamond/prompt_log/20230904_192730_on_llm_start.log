Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.
Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: diamond.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows required for the diamond
    num_rows = ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1

    # Initialize an empty list to store the rows of the diamond
    diamond = []

    # Iterate over the rows
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Calculate the number of leading and trailing spaces
        leading_spaces = (num_rows - i - 1) // 2
        trailing_spaces = num_rows - leading_spaces - 1

        # Add the leading and trailing spaces to the row
        row = " " * leading_spaces + chr(ord('A') + i) + " " * trailing_spaces

        # Append the row to the diamond
        diamond.append(row)

    # Return the diamond
    return "
".join(diamond)

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in diamond.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows required for the diamond
    num_rows = ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1

    # Initialize an empty list to store the rows of the diamond
    diamond = []

    # Iterate over the rows
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Calculate the number of leading and trailing spaces
        leading_spaces = (num_rows - i - 1) // 2
        trailing_spaces = num_rows - leading_spaces - 1

        # Add the leading and trailing spaces to the row
        row = " " * leading_spaces + chr(ord('A') + i) + " " * trailing_spaces
