Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

# Instructions

Implement run-length encoding and decoding.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data elements) are replaced by just one data value and count.

For example we can represent the original 53 characters with only 13.

```text
"WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"  ->  "12WB12W3B24WB"
```

RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, which makes it a lossless data compression.

```text
"AABCCCDEEEE"  ->  "2AB3CD4E"  ->  "AABCCCDEEEE"
```

For simplicity, you can assume that the unencoded string will only contain the letters A through Z (either lower or upper case) and whitespace.
This way data to be encoded will never contain any numbers and numbers inside data to be decoded always represent the count for the following character.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: run_length_encoding.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```python

import re

def decode(string):
    # Split the input string into a list of substrings using regex
    substrings = re.split('(\d+)', string)

    # Initialize an empty output string
    output = ''

    # Iterate over the substrings
    for substring in substrings:
        # Check if the current substring is a digit
        if substring.isdigit():
            # If it is, convert it to an integer and repeat the previous substring that many times
            output += substring * int(substring)
        else:
            # Otherwise, append the substring to the output without modification
            output += substring

    return output

def encode(string):
    # Initialize an empty output string
    output = ''

    # Get the length of the input string
    length = len(string)

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the current count and the previous character
    count = 0
    prev_char = None

    # Iterate over the characters in the input string
    for char in string:
        # Check if the current character is the same as the previous character
        if char != prev_char:
            # If it isn't, reset the count to 1
            count = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, increment the count
            count += 1

        # Set the previous character to the current character
        prev_char = char

        # Add the current character and count to the output string
        output += f'{count}{char}'

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in run_length_encoding.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: run_length_encoding.py
```python

    for substring in substrings:
        # Check if the current substring is a digit
        if substring.isdigit():
            # If it is, convert it to an integer and repeat the previous substring that many times
            output += substring * int(substring)
        else:
            # Otherwise, append the substring to the output without modification
