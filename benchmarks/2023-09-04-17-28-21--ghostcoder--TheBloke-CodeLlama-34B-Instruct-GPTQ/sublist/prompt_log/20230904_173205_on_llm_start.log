Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:

- List `A` is equal to list `B`; or
- List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or
- List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or
- None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal

Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.
List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.
List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.

Examples:

- If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,

It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
