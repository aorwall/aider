# Instructions

Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).

The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

- eggs (1)
- peanuts (2)
- shellfish (4)
- strawberries (8)
- tomatoes (16)
- chocolate (32)
- pollen (64)
- cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

- Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.
- All the allergens Tom is allergic to.

Note: a given score may include allergens **not** listed above (i.e.  allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.).
Your program should ignore those components of the score.
For example, if the allergy score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: allergies.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

class Allergies:

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        # Check if the item is in the list of allergies
        if item in self.lst:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    @property

        for i in bin(self.score)[2:]:
            # If the current bit is set, add the corresponding allergy to the list
            if int(i) == 1:
                lst.append(allergies[int(i)])

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in allergies.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: allergies.py
```python
class Allergies:

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        # Check if the item is in the list of allergies
        if item in self.lst:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    @property
    def lst(self):
        # Create a dictionary of allergies and their values
        allergies = {
            1: "eggs",
            2: "peanuts",
