Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):

[/INST] Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]

Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

# Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
import multiprocessing
from collections import Counter

def calculate(text_input):
    # Split text into smaller chunks
    chunk_size = len(text_input) // multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    chunks = (text_input[i : i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text_input), chunk_size))

    # Create a process pool and map the chunks to processes
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(calculate_chunk, chunks)

    # Combine the results from each process
    combined_results = {}
    for result in results:
        for key, value in result.items():
            combined_results[key] = combined_results.get(key, 0) + value

    return combined_results

def calculate_chunk(chunk):

    return counter

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in parallel_letter_frequency.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
import multiprocessing
from collections import Counter

def calculate(text_input):
    # Split text into smaller chunks
    chunk_size = len(text_input) // multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    chunks = (text_input[i : i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text_input), chunk_size))

    # Create a process pool and map the chunks to processes
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(calculate_chunk, chunks)

    # Combine the results from each process
    combined_results = {}
    for result in results:
        for key, value in result.items():
            combined_results[key] = combined_results.get(key, 0) + value

    return combined_results
