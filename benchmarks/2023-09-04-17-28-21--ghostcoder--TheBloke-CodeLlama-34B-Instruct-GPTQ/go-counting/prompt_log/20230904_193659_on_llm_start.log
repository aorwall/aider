# Instructions

Count the scored points on a Go board.

In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.
The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.

Write a function that determines the territory of each player.
You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.

Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.

Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.
In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).
Empty spaces represent empty intersections.

```text
+----+
|IOOI|
|O  O|
|O OI|
|IOI |
+----+
```

To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the coordinates for the piece are invalid
raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')
```
