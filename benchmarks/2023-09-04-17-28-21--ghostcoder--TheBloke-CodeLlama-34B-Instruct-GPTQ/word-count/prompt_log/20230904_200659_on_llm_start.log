When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Introduction

You teach English as a foreign language to high school students.

You've decided to base your entire curriculum on TV shows.
You need to analyze which words are used, and how often they're repeated.

This will let you choose the simplest shows to start with, and to gradually increase the difficulty as time passes.
# Instructions

Your task is to count how many times each word occurs in a subtitle of a drama.

The subtitles from these dramas use only ASCII characters.

The characters often speak in casual English, using contractions like _they're_ or _it's_.
Though these contractions come from two words (e.g. _we are_), the contraction (_we're_) is considered a single word.

Words can be separated by any form of punctuation (e.g. ":", "!", or "?") or whitespace (e.g. "\t", "
", or " ").
The only punctuation that does not separate words is the apostrophe in contractions.

Numbers are considered words.
If the subtitles say _It costs 100 dollars._ then _100_ will be its own word.

Words are case insensitive.
For example, the word _you_ occurs three times in the following sentence:

> You come back, you hear me? DO YOU HEAR ME?

The ordering of the word counts in the results doesn't matter.

Here's an example that incorporates several of the elements discussed above:

- simple words
- contractions
- numbers
- case insensitive words
- punctuation (including apostrophes) to separate words
- different forms of whitespace to separate words

`"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.
So I fled.`

The mapping for this subtitle would be:

```text
123: 1
agent: 1
cried: 1
fled: 1
i: 1
password: 2
so: 1
special: 1
that's: 1
the: 2
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_count.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: word_count.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: word_count.py
```python
import re

def count_words(sentence):
    # Remove punctuations and convert to lowercase
    sentence = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z\d]+', '', sentence).lower()

    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Create a dictionary to store the word counts
    word_counts = {}

    # Iterate over the words and increment the count for each one
    for word in words:
        if word not in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] = 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] += 1

    return word_counts

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in word_count.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: word_count.py
```python
import re

def count_words(sentence):
    # Remove punctuations and convert to lowercase
    sentence = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z\d]+', '', sentence).lower()

    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Create a dictionary to store the word counts
    word_counts = {}

    # Iterate over the words and increment the count for each one
    for word in words:
        if word not in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] = 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] += 1

    return word_counts
