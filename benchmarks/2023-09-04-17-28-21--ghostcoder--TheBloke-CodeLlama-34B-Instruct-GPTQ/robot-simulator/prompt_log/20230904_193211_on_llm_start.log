Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.
  Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        # Initialize the robot's attributes
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def move(self, instruction):
        # Implement the logic to move the robot according to the instruction
        # Use the global variables EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH to determine the direction of movement
        # Update the robot's position accordingly
        # Return the final position of the robot
        pass

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_simulator.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        # Initialize the robot's attributes
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def move(self, instruction):
        # Implement the logic to move the robot according to the instruction
        # Use the global variables EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH to determine the direction of movement
        # Update the robot's position accordingly
