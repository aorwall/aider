Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.
A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.

Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.

The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).
Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.
The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).
Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.

Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

    # Sort each word to normalize their letter order
    sorted_target = "".join(sorted(target))
    sorted_candidates = ["".join(sorted(w)) for w in candidates]

    # Find the anagrams by comparing the sorted words
    anagrams = []
    for cand in sorted_candidates:
        if cand == sorted_target:
            anagrams.append(cand)

    # Return the original unsorted words
    return [w for w in candidates if "".join(sorted(w)) in anagrams]

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in anagram.py to resolve the errors.
