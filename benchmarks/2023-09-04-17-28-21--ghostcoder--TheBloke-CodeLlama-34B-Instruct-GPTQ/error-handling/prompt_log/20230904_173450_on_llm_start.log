Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```
[/INST] Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
# Hints

For the `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception` function, the `filelike_object`
will be an instance of a custom `FileLike` class defined in the test suite. This
class implements the following methods:
- `open` and `close`, for explicit opening and closing.
- `__enter__` and `__exit__`, for implicit opening and closing.
- `do_something`, which may or may not throw an `Exception`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: error_handling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: error_handling.py
```python
def handle_error_by_throwing_exception():
    pass


def handle_error_by_returning_none(input_data):
    pass


def handle_error_by_returning_tuple(input_data):
    pass


def filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception(filelike_object):
    pass
