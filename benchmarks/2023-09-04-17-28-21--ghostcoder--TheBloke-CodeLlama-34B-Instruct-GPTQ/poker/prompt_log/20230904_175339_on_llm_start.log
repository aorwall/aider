# Instructions

Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia][poker-hands] for an overview of poker hands.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: poker.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
