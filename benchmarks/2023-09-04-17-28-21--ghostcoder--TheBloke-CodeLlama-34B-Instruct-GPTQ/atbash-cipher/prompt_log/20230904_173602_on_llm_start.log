# Instructions

Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.
The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.

An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```text
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.
However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries.
All text will be encoded as lowercase letters.

## Examples

- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`
- Encoding `x123 yes` gives `c123b vh`
- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`
- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: atbash_cipher.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: atbash_cipher.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: atbash_cipher.py
```python
import string

def encode(plain_text):
    # Create a dictionary to map each character to its corresponding encrypted character
    char_map = {chr(i+97): chr((26 - (i % 26)) + 97) for i in range(26)}

    # Replace each character in the plain text with its encrypted counterpart
    cipher_text = ''.join([char_map[c] for c in plain_text])

    # Group the characters into blocks of five and separate them by spaces
    cipher_text = ' '.join([cipher_text[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(cipher_text), 5)])

    return cipher_text

def decode(ciphered_text):
    # Create a dictionary to map each encrypted character to its corresponding decrypted character
    char_map = {chr((26 - (i % 26)) + 97): chr(i+97) for i in range(26)}

    # Replace each encrypted character in the cipher text with its decrypted counterpart
    plain_text = ''.join([char_map[c] for c in ciphered_text])

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in atbash_cipher.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: atbash_cipher.py
```python
import string

    # Create a dictionary to map each character to its corresponding encrypted character
    char_map = {chr(i+97): chr((26 - (i % 26)) + 97) for i in range(26)}

    # Replace each character in the plain text with its encrypted counterpart
    cipher_text = ''.join([char_map[c] for c in plain_text])

    # Group the characters into blocks of five and separate them by spaces
    cipher_text = ' '.join([cipher_text[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(cipher_text), 5)])

    return cipher_text

def decode(ciphered_text):
    # Create a dictionary to map each encrypted character to its corresponding decrypted character
