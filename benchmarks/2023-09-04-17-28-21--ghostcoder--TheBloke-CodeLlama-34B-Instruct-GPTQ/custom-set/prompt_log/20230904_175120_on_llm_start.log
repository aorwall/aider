Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```
[/INST] Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

# Instructions

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some type, like a set.
In this exercise you will define your own set.
How it works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of unique elements.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: custom_set.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: custom_set.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: custom_set.py
```python
from typing import Any

class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=None):
        # Initialize empty list to store elements
        self._elements = []

        # If elements argument is passed, add them to the set
        if elements is not None:
            for element in elements:
                self.add(element)

    def isempty(self) -> bool:
        """Return True if the set contains no elements."""
        return len(self._elements) == 0

    def __contains__(self, element: Any) -> bool:
        """Return True if the element is in the set."""
        return element in self._elements

    def issubset(self, other: "CustomSet") -> bool:
        """Return True if every element in the set is also in other."""
        return all(elem in other for elem in self._elements)

    def isdisjoint(self, other: "CustomSet") -> bool:
        """Return True if there are no common elements between the sets."""
        return not (self & other).isempty()

    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Return True if the sets contain the same elements."""
        return self._elements == getattr(other, "_elements", [])

    def add(self, element: Any) -> None:
        """Add an element to the set."""
        if element not in self._elements:
            self._elements.append(element)

    def intersection(self, other: "CustomSet") -> "CustomSet":
        """Return a new set containing only the common elements."""
        return CustomSet([elem for elem in self._elements if elem in other])

    def __sub__(self, other: "CustomSet") -> "CustomSet":
        """Return a new set containing only the elements in the left operand but not in the right operand."""
        return CustomSet([elem for elem in self._elements if elem not in other])

    def __add__(self, other: "CustomSet") -> "CustomSet":
        """Return a new set containing all elements from both sets."""
        return CustomSet(self._elements + other._elements)

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in custom_set.py to resolve the errors.
