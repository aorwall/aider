# Instructions

Implement encoding and decoding for the rail fence cipher.

The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded.
It was already used by the ancient Greeks.

In the Rail Fence cipher, the message is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom (like a zig-zag).
Finally the message is then read off in rows.

For example, using three "rails" and the message "WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE", the cipherer writes out:

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .
```

Then reads off:

```text
WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN
```

To decrypt a message you take the zig-zag shape and fill the ciphertext along the rows.

```text
? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ?
. ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

The first row has seven spots that can be filled with "WECRLTE".

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

Now the 2nd row takes "ERDSOEEFEAOC".

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .
```

Leaving "AIVDEN" for the last row.

```text
W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .
```

If you now read along the zig-zag shape you can read the original message.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rail_fence_cipher.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

    # Initialize empty matrix to store the encoded message
    encoded_matrix = [[''] * len(message) for _ in range(rails)]

    # Loop through each character in the message
    for i, char in enumerate(message):
        # Calculate the row index based on the current iteration number
        row_index = i % rails

        # Add the character to the corresponding position in the matrix
        encoded_matrix[row_index][i] = char

    # Flatten the matrix into a single string
    encoded_string = ''.join([char for row in encoded_matrix for char in row])

    return encoded_string


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    # Initialize empty list to store the decoded characters
    decoded_chars = []

    # Loop through each character in the encoded message
    for i, char in enumerate(encoded_message):

        col_index = int((len(encoded_message) / rails) - ((i // rails) + 1))

        # Append the character at the calculated position in the matrix to the decoded chars list
        decoded_chars.append(encoded_message[col_index][row_index])

    # Join the decoded chars list into a single string
    decoded_string = ''.join(decoded_chars)

    return decoded_string
