Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

[INST]Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.

Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

# Instructions

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;
the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the slice length is zero.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")

# if the slice length is negative.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")

# if the series provided is empty.
raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

# if the slice length is longer than the series.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []

    # Check if the input series is empty
    if not series:
        raise ValueError("Series cannot be empty.")

    # Check if the slice length is valid

    # Check if the slice length is longer than the series
    if length > len(series):

    # Iterate over the series
    for i in range(len(series)):

        if (i + length - 1) < len(series):

The tests are correct.
Fix the code in series.py to resolve the errors.
