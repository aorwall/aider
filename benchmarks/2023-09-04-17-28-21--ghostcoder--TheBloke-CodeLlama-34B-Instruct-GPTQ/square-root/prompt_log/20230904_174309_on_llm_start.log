Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Given a natural radicand, return its square root.

Note that the term "radicand" refers to the number for which the root is to be determined.
That is, it is the number under the root symbol.

Check out the Wikipedia pages on [square root][square-root] and [methods of computing square roots][computing-square-roots].

Recall also that natural numbers are positive real whole numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and up).

## How this Exercise is Structured in Python


Python offers a wealth of mathematical functions in the form of the [math module][math-module] and built-ins such as [`pow()`][pow] and [`sum()`][sum].
However, we'd like you to consider the challenge of solving this exercise without those built-ins or modules.

While there is a mathematical formula that will find the square root of _any_ number, we have gone the route of only testing [natural numbers][nautral-number] (positive integers).

[sum]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: square_root.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: square_root.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    """
    Calculate the square root of a natural number using the Babylonian method.
    
    Args:
        number (int): The natural number to calculate the square root of.
        
    Returns:
        int: The calculated square root of the input number.
    """
    # Initialize the guess for the square root
    guess = number / 2

    # Iteratively improve the guess until it matches the expected precision
    while abs(guess ** 2 - number) >= 1:
        guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2

    return int(guess)
