# Instructions

Implement a RESTful API for tracking IOUs.

Four roommates have a habit of borrowing money from each other frequently, and have trouble remembering who owes whom, and how much.

Your task is to implement a simple [RESTful API][restful-wikipedia] that receives [IOU][iou]s as POST requests, and can deliver specified summary information via GET requests.

## API Specification

### User object

```json
{
  "name": "Adam",
  "owes": {
    "Bob": 12.0,
    "Chuck": 4.0,
    "Dan": 9.5
  },
  "owed_by": {
    "Bob": 6.5,
    "Dan": 2.75,
  },
  "balance": "<(total owed by other users) - (total owed to other users)>"
}
```

### Methods

| Description | HTTP Method | URL | Payload Format | Response w/o Payload | Response w/ Payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List of user information | GET | /users | `{"users":["Adam","Bob"]}` | `{"users":<List of all User objects>}` | `{"users":<List of User objects for <users> (sorted by name)}` |
| Create user | POST | /add | `{"user":<name of new user (unique)>}` | N/A | `<User object for new user>` |
| Create IOU | POST | /iou | `{"lender":<name of lender>,"borrower":<name of borrower>,"amount":5.25}` | N/A | `{"users":<updated User objects for <lender> and <borrower> (sorted by name)>}` |

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rest_api.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
