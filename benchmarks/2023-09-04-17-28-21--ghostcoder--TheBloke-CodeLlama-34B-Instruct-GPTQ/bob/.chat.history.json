Be that way!\"**\n  This is how he responds to silence.\n  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.\n- **\"Whatever.\"**\n  This is what he answers to anything else.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
