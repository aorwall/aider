When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Introduction

Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.
He likes to think that he's very cool.
And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.
That wouldn't be cool.

When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: bob.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.endswith('?'):
        return 'Sure.'
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        return 'Whoa, chill out!'
    elif hey_bob.startswith('WHAT'):
        return 'Calm down, I know what I\'m doing!'
    elif len(hey_bob) <= 0:
        return 'Fine. Be that way!'
    else:
        return 'Whatever.'

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bob.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.endswith('?'):
        return 'Sure.'
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        return 'Whoa, chill out!'
    elif hey_bob.startswith('WHAT'):
        return 'Calm down, I know what I\'m doing!'
    elif len(hey_bob) <= 0:
        return 'Fine. Be that way!'
    else:
        return 'Whatever.'
