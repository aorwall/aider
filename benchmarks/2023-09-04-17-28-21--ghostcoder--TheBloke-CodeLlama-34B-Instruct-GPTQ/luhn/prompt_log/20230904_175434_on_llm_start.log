# Instructions

Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.

The [Luhn algorithm][luhn] is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.

The task is to check if a given string is valid.

## Validating a Number

Strings of length 1 or less are not valid.
Spaces are allowed in the input, but they should be stripped before checking.
All other non-digit characters are disallowed.

### Example 1: valid credit card number

```text
4539 3195 0343 6467
```

The first step of the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit, starting from the right.
We will be doubling

```text
4_3_ 3_9_ 0_4_ 6_6_
```

If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9 then subtract 9 from the product.
The results of our doubling:

```text
8569 6195 0383 3437
```

Then sum all of the digits:

```text
8+5+6+9+6+1+9+5+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80
```

If the sum is evenly divisible by 10, then the number is valid.
This number is valid!

### Example 2: invalid credit card number

```text
8273 1232 7352 0569
```

Double the second digits, starting from the right

```text
7253 2262 5312 0539
```

Sum the digits

```text
7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57
```

57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so this number is not valid.

        total = 0
        for i in range(-1, -len(card_num), -2):
            digit = int(card_num[i])
            if digit >= 5:
                digit -= 9
            total += digit

        # Sum all the digits
        total += sum(map(int, card_num[-1::-2]))

        # If the total is divisible by 10, the card number is valid
        return total % 10 == 0
