Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

# Instructions

Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.

A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

Note that 1 is not a prime number.

## Example

What are the prime factors of 60?

- Our first divisor is 2.
  2 goes into 60, leaving 30.
- 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
  - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.
    So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.
- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.
    The next possible factor is 4.
  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.
    The next possible factor is 5.
- 5 does go cleanly into 5.
- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.

Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.

You can check this yourself:

```text
2 * 2 * 3 * 5
= 4 * 15
= 60
```

Success!
