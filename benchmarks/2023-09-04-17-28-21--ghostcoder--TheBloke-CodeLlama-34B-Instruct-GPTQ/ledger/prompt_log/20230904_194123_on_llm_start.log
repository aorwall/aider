Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Refactor a ledger printer.

The ledger exercise is a refactoring exercise.
There is code that prints a nicely formatted ledger, given a locale (American or Dutch) and a currency (US dollar or euro).
The code however is rather badly written, though (somewhat surprisingly) it consistently passes the test suite.

Rewrite this code.
Remember that in refactoring the trick is to make small steps that keep the tests passing.
That way you can always quickly go back to a working version.
Version control tools like git can help here as well.

Please keep a log of what changes you've made and make a comment on the exercise containing that log, this will help reviewers.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: ledger.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
