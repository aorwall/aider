# Instructions

The [ISBN-10 verification process][isbn-verification] is used to validate book identification numbers.
These normally contain dashes and look like: `3-598-21508-8`

## ISBN

The ISBN-10 format is 9 digits (0 to 9) plus one check character (either a digit or an X only).
In the case the check character is an X, this represents the value '10'.
These may be communicated with or without hyphens, and can be checked for their validity by the following formula:

```text
(d₁ * 10 + d₂ * 9 + d₃ * 8 + d₄ * 7 + d₅ * 6 + d₆ * 5 + d₇ * 4 + d₈ * 3 + d₉ * 2 + d₁₀ * 1) mod 11 == 0
```

If the result is 0, then it is a valid ISBN-10, otherwise it is invalid.

## Example

Let's take the ISBN-10 `3-598-21508-8`.
We plug it in to the formula, and get:

```text
(3 * 10 + 5 * 9 + 9 * 8 + 8 * 7 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 5 + 5 * 4 + 0 * 3 + 8 * 2 + 8 * 1) mod 11 == 0
```

Since the result is 0, this proves that our ISBN is valid.

## Task

Given a string the program should check if the provided string is a valid ISBN-10.
Putting this into place requires some thinking about preprocessing/parsing of the string prior to calculating the check digit for the ISBN.

The program should be able to verify ISBN-10 both with and without separating dashes.

## Caveats

Converting from strings to numbers can be tricky in certain languages.
Now, it's even trickier since the check digit of an ISBN-10 may be 'X' (representing '10').
For instance `3-598-21507-X` is a valid ISBN-10.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in isbn_verifier.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: isbn_verifier.py
```python
import re

def is_valid(isbn):
    # Remove non-numeric characters and convert to list
    isbn = re.sub('[^0-9X]', '', str(isbn)).upper()
    isbn = list(isbn)

    # Convert last char to numeric value
    if isbn[-1] == 'X':
        isbn[-1] = 10
    else:
        isbn[-1] = int(isbn[-1])

    # Calculate sum
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(isbn[:-1], start=1):
        total += i * int(num)

    # Checksum calculation
    remainder = total % 11
    checksum = 11 - remainder if remainder != 0 else 0

    # Compare calculated checksum with inputted checksum
    return True if checksum == isbn[-1] else False
