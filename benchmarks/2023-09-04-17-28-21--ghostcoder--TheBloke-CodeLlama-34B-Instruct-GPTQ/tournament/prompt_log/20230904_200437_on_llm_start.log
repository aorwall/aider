Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Tally the results of a small football competition.

Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:

```text
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

What do those abbreviations mean?

- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points.
A draw earns 1.
A loss earns 0.

The outcome is ordered by points, descending.
In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

## Input

Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win
```

The result of the match refers to the first team listed.
So this line:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
```

means that the Allegoric Alaskans beat the Blithering Badgers.

This line:

```text
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
```

means that the Blithering Badgers beat the Courageous Californians.

And this line:

```text
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
```

means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.
