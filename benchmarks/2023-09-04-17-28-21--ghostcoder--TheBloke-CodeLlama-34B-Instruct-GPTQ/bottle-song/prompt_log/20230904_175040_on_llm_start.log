# Instructions

Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.

Note that not all verses are identical.

```text
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.

Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.

Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.

Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.

Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.

Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.

Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.

Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.

Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.

One green bottle hanging on the wall,
One green bottle hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python

```
[/INST] Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the verses
    verses = []

    # Iterate over the number of verses to recite
    for verse in range(take):
        # Calculate the number of green bottles for this verse
        num_bottles = start - verse

        # Add the verse to the list of verses
        verses.append(f"{num_bottles} green bottles hanging on the wall")

    # Return the list of verses as a single string, separated by newline characters
    return "

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bottle_song.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the verses
    verses = []

    # Iterate over the number of verses to recite
    for verse in range(take):
        # Calculate the number of green bottles for this verse
        num_bottles = start - verse

        # Add the verse to the list of verses
        verses.append(f"{num_bottles} green bottles hanging on the wall")

    # Return the list of verses as a single string, separated by newline characters
    return "
".join(verses)
