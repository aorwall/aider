Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last letter of each word.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_search.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
