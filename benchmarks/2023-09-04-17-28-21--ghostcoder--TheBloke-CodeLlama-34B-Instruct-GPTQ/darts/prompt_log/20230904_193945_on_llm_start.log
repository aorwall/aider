Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

[Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: darts.py
```python
def score(x, y):
    pass

```
