# Instructions

Creating a zipper for a binary tree.

[Zippers][zipper] are a purely functional way of navigating within a data structure and manipulating it.
They essentially contain a data structure and a pointer into that data structure (called the focus).

For example given a rose tree (where each node contains a value and a list of child nodes) a zipper might support these operations:

- `from_tree` (get a zipper out of a rose tree, the focus is on the root node)
- `to_tree` (get the rose tree out of the zipper)
- `value` (get the value of the focus node)
- `prev` (move the focus to the previous child of the same parent,
  returns a new zipper)
- `next` (move the focus to the next child of the same parent, returns a
  new zipper)
- `up` (move the focus to the parent, returns a new zipper)
- `set_value` (set the value of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_before` (insert a new subtree before the focus node, it
  becomes the `prev` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_after` (insert a new subtree after the focus node, it becomes
  the `next` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `delete` (removes the focus node and all subtrees, focus moves to the
  `next` node if possible otherwise to the `prev` node if possible,
  otherwise to the parent node, returns a new zipper)
