Here's how I would update `isogram.py`:

```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '')
    string = string.replace('-', '')
    
    return len(string) == len(set(string))
```

This function works by first removing all spaces and hyphens from the input string using the `replace` method. Then it checks whether the length of the resulting string equals the length of its unique characters (i.e., no character appears more than once). This is done by converting the string to a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and comparing the lengths of both. If they are equal, then every character in the string was unique, so the string is an isogram. Otherwise, there were some repeated characters, so the string isn't an isogram.
