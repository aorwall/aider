prompt:
It seems like there is an issue with your `go_counting_test.py` file where it tries to import a constant named `WHITE` which doesn't exist in your updated `go_counting.py`. To fix this error, you should remove or replace the problematic import statement in your `go_counting_test.py` file. If you need help fixing that file as well, please provide its content and I will be glad to assist.
