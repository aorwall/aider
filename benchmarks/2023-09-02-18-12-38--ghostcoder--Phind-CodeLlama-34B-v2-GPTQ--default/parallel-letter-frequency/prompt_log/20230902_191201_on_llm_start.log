# Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's how I would approach this problem. We can use concurrent.futures threading to achieve parallelism. Here's an implementation of `calculate` function:
Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```
import collections
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
def calculate(text_input):
    def count_letters(text):
        return dict(collections.Counter(text))

    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(count_letters, text_input))

    final_result = results[0]
    for result in results[1:]:
        for key, value in result.items():
            if key in final_result:
                final_result[key] += value
            else:
                final_result[key] = value

    return final_result

```

This function uses Python's built-in `concurrent.futures` module which allows us to easily parallelize tasks. In this case, we are using `ThreadPoolExecutor()` to create a pool of worker threads that will process subtasks concurrently. 

The `count_letters` helper function is used to count letter frequencies within each individual string (or "subtask") and then all the results are combined together at the end. The combination step takes into account that some letters might not appear in every text input, so it adds up all the counts rather than just overwriting them.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in parallel_letter_frequency.py to resolve the errors.
