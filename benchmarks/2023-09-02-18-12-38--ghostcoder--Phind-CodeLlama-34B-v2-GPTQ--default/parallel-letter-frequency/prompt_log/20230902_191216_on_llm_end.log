Here's an updated version of `calculate` function that should pass those tests:
Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
import collections
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
def calculate(text_input):
    def count_letters(text):
        return dict(collections.Counter(text))

    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(count_letters, text_input))

    final_result = collections.defaultdict(int)
    for result in results:
        for key, value in result.items():
            if key.isalpha(): # only consider alphabetic characters
                final_result[key.lower()] += value

    return dict(final_result)
```
This new implementation still uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, but it now also uses a `collections.defaultdict(int)` to ensure that we don't encounter any KeyError exceptions when adding up our counts. The `key.isalpha()` check inside the loop ensures that we're only counting alphabetical characters (ignoring punctuation and other non-alphabetic characters).
