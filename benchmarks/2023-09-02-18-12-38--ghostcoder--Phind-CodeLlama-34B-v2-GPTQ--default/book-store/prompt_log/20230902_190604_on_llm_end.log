Here is an updated version of `book_store.py` that calculates the total cost of a basket of books according to the rules specified:

```python
def calculate_discount(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 0.05
    elif n == 3:
        return 0.10
    elif n == 4:
        return 0.20
    else:
        return 0.25

def total(basket):
    # Initialize total price as zero
    total_price = 0
    
    # Count number of different books in the basket
    unique_books = len(set(basket))
    
    # Group books by their counts
    grouped_books = {}
    for book in basket:
        if book in grouped_books:
            grouped_books[book] += 1
        else:
            grouped_books[book] = 1
            
    # Calculate total price based on group sizes and apply discounts
    for count in grouped_books.values():
        total_price += (calculate_discount(unique_books) * count + unique_books - 1) * 8 / unique_books
        
    return round(total_price, 2)
```

This code first determines the applicable discount based on the number of unique books in the basket. It then groups the books by their counts and calculates the total cost using the formula described in the instructions. The result is rounded to two decimal places before being returned.
