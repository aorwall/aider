prompt:
The error is due to a naming conflict between the script file and the module it tries to import. To fix this issue, you can rename your `rectangles.py` file to something else like `count_rectangles.py`. Then update the import statement in `rectangles_test.py` accordingly.

For example, if you renamed your `rectangles.py` to `count_rectangles.py`, you would need to change the import statement in `rectangles_test.py` as follows:
```python
from count_rectangles import count_rectangles
```
