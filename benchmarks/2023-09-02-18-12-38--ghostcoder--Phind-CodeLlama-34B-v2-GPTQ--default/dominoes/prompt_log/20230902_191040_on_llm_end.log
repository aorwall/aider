Here is how I would approach this problem using backtracking algorithm. The idea is to start adding the dominos one by one, if it is possible according to the rules of dominoes then add it to the sequence, else undo the addition and try another path. If we reach a dead end (i.e., no further domino can be added), then backtrack to the previous step. This process continues until we find a complete sequence or we have explored all possibilities and could not find a valid sequence.

```python
def can_chain(dominoes):
    # Sort the dominos based on the LHS value
    sorted_dominoes = sorted(dominoes)
    
    n = len(sorted_dominoes)
    
    # Create a visited array to store the already used dominos
    visited = [False]*n
    
    # Start from the 0th domino as it has to be the starting point
    result = []
    
    if not _can_chain_util(sorted_dominoes, visited, 0, -1, result):
        return None
        
    return result + [result[0]]

def _can_chain_util(sorted_dominoes, visited, pos, prev, result):
    if pos == len(sorted_dominoes):
        # If we have reached the last domino and it matches with the first element in result
        if sorted_dominoes[pos][1] == result[0][0]:
            return True
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(sorted_dominoes)):
        # Check if this domino can be placed at the current position
        if !visited[i] and sorted_dominoes[i][1] == sorted_dominoes[pos][0]:
            # Mark this domino as visited and add it to the result
            visited[i] = True
            result.append(sorted_dominoes[i])
            
            # Recurse for the next position
            if _can_chain_util(sorted_dominoes, visited, pos+1, sorted_dominoes[i], result):
                return True
            
            # If placing this domino doesn't lead to a solution then remove it from the result
            visited[i] = False
            result.pop()
            
    return False
```
This function `can_chain` takes an array of dominos as input and returns a sequence of dominos that form a valid chain or None if no such sequence is possible. The helper function `_can_chain_util` performs the actual backtracking.
