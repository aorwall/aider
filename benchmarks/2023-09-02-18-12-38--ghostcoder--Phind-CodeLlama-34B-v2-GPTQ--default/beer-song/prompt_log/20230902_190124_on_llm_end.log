Here is an implementation for `recite` method in `beer_song.py`:

```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    verses = []
    
    for i in range(start-take+1, -1, -1):
        if i > 0:
            line1 = f"{i} bottles of beer on the wall, {i} bottles of beer."
            line2 = "Take one down and pass it around, "
            line3 = f"{i-1} bottles of beer on the wall."
            verse = line1 + "\n" + line2 + line3
        else:
            line1 = "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer."
            line2 = "Go to the store and buy some more, "
            line3 = f"{99} bottles of beer on the wall."
            verse = line1 + "\n" + line2 + line3
        
        verses.append(verse)
    
    return '\n'.join(verses)
```
This function takes two arguments: `start`, which specifies the number of bottles of beer at the start (from where we begin counting down), and `take`, which indicates how many verses to recite. The function creates a list of verses, each as a string, starting from `start` and going down to 0. It then returns the joined list of verses with newline characters in between.
