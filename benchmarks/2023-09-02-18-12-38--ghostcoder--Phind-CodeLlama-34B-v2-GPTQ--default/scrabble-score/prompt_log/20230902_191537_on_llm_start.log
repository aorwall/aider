# Instructions

Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions

- You can play a double or a triple letter.
- You can play a double or a triple word.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: scrabble_score.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is an updated version of your file with a working implementation of the score function:
Filepath: scrabble_score.py
```
def score(word):
    # Define the point values for each letter
    point_values = {
        'A': 1, 'E': 1, 'I': 1, 'O': 1, 'U': 1, 'L': 1, 'N': 1, 'R': 1, 'S': 1, 'T': 1,
        'D': 2, 'G': 2,
        'B': 3, 'C': 3, 'M': 3, 'P': 3,
        'F': 4, 'H': 4, 'V': 4, 'W': 4, 'Y': 4,
        'K': 5,
        'J': 8, 'X': 8,
        'Q': 10, 'Z': 10
    }

    # Calculate the total score by summing up the points for each character in the word
    return sum([point_values[char] for char in word])

```
