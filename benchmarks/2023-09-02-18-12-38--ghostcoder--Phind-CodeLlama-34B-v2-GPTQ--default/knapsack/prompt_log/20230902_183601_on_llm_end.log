Here is an implementation using dynamic programming:

```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize a list with zeroes up to the maximum weight + 1
    dp = [0] * (maximum_weight + 1)
    
    # For each item
    for wi, vi in items:
        # For each possible weight from the item's weight down to zero
        for w in range(wi, -1, -1):
            # Update the maximum value obtainable with this item included
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[max(0, w - wi)] + vi)
            
    return dp[0]
```

This code uses a bottom-up approach by iterating over all weights from high to low. It keeps track of the maximum value that can be obtained with the items considered so far, where an item is considered if it fits within the remaining capacity of the knapsack. The time complexity is O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight.
