# Instructions

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows.
See [transpose][].

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is how you can update `transpose.py`:
Filepath: transpose.py
```
def transpose(lines):
    # Split lines into list of strings
    lines = [list(line) for line in lines]

    # Find max length for padding
    max_len = max([len(l) for l in lines])

    # Transpose lines into columns
    cols = [[[] for _ in range(max_len)] for _ in range(len(lines))]
    for col_idx in range(max_len):
        for line in reversed(lines):
            try:
                cols[col_idx].append(line[col_idx])
            except IndexError:
                cols[col_idx].append(' ')

    # Join columns back into lines
    transposed_lines = [''.join(col).rstrip() for col in zip(*cols)]

    return transposed_lines

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in transpose.py to resolve the errors.
