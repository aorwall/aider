Here is how you can update `transpose.py`:

Filepath: transpose.py
```python
def transpose(lines):
    # Split lines into list of strings
    lines = [list(line) for line in lines]
    
    # Find max length for padding
    max_len = max([len(l) for l in lines])
    
    # Transpose lines into columns
    cols = [[[] for _ in range(max_len)] for _ in range(len(lines))]
    for col_idx in range(max_len):
        for line in reversed(lines):
            try:
                cols[col_idx].append(line[col_idx])
            except IndexError:
                cols[col_idx].append(' ')
    
    # Join columns back into lines
    transposed_lines = [''.join(col).rstrip() for col in zip(*cols)]
    
    return transposed_lines
```
