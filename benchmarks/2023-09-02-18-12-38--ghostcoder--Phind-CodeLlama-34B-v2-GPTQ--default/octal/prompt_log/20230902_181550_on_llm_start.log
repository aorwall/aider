# Instructions

Convert an octal number, represented as a string (e.g. '1735263'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in or external libraries to accomplish the conversion).

Implement octal to decimal conversion.
Given an octal input string, your program should produce a decimal output.

## Note

- Implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.
- Treat invalid input as octal 0.

## About Octal (Base-8)

Decimal is a base-10 system.

A number 233 in base 10 notation can be understood
as a linear combination of powers of 10:

- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1
- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10
- ...
- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.
- All these values are summed.

So:

```text
   233 # decimal
 = 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
 = 2*100  + 3*10   + 3*1
```

Octal is similar, but uses powers of 8 rather than powers of 10.

So:

```text
   233 # octal
 = 2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 3*8^0
 = 2*64  + 3*8   + 3*1
 = 128   + 24    + 3
 = 155
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: octal.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is an updated version of your `octal.py` file that includes a complete implementation of the `parse_octal` function:
Filepath: octal.py
```
def parse_octal(digits):
    """Convert an octal number, represented as a string, to its decimal equivalent."""

    if not digits.isdigit() or int(digits) == 0:
        return 0

    decimal = 0
    power = len(digits) - 1

    for digit in reversed(digits):
        decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** power)
        power -= 1

    return decimal

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in octal.py to resolve the errors.
