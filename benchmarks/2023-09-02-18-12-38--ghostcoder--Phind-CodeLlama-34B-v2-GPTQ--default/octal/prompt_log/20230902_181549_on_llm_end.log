Here is an updated version of your `octal.py` file that includes a complete implementation of the `parse_octal` function:

Filepath: octal.py
```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    """Convert an octal number, represented as a string, to its decimal equivalent."""
    
    if not digits.isdigit() or int(digits) == 0:
        return 0
        
    decimal = 0
    power = len(digits) - 1
    
    for digit in reversed(digits):
        decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** power)
        power -= 1
        
    return decimal
```
