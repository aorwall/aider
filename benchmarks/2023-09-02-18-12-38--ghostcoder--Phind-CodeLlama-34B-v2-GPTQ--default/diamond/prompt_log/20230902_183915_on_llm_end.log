Here is an updated version of your `diamond.py`:

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    index = alphabet.index(letter)
    
    top_half = list(map(chr, range(65, 65+index)))[::-1]
    bottom_half = list(map(chr, range(65+index, 74)))
    
    lines = []
    max_width = len(" ".join(top_half))
    
    for i in range(len(top_half)):
        line = "".join((top_half[i], ) + tuple(' ' * (max_width - 2*len(top_half[i]))))
        if i < len(bottom_half):
            line += bottom_half[i]
        lines.append(line)
        
    return "\n".join(lines)
```
This implementation creates a list of characters for the upper half of the diamond in reverse order and a list of characters for the lower half in ascending order. It then iterates over these lists, creating each row by joining the corresponding characters from both halves with appropriate number of spaces. The maximum width of the output is calculated as twice the length of the widest character in the first half.
