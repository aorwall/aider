Here is an updated version of your rotational_cipher.py file with a functional implementation of the Caesar Cipher:

```python
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ""
    
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
            encrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + key) % 26 + ascii_offset)
            result += encrypted_char
        else:
            result += char
            
    return result
```
This code works by iterating through each character in the input string. If the character is alphabetic, it calculates the new character after shifting by the specified key, ensuring that it remains within the bounds of the alphabet by using modular arithmetic. Non-alphabetic characters are added directly to the resulting string.
