Here's how I would update `acronym.py`:

```python
import re

def abbreviate(phrase):
    words = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', phrase).split()
    return ''.join([word[0].upper() for word in words])
```

This updated version uses regular expressions (`re` module) to remove punctuation and split the phrase into words. The updated `abbreviate()` function takes a phrase, removes non-alphanumeric characters with `re.sub()`, splits it into words with `str.split()`, then returns an acronym string created by taking the first character of each word and converting it to uppercase.
