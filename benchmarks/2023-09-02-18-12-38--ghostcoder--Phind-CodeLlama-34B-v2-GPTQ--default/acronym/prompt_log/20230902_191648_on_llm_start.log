# Instructions

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

Punctuation is handled as follows: hyphens are word separators (like whitespace); all other punctuation can be removed from the input.

For example:

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|As Soon As Possible|ASAP|
|Liquid-crystal display|LCD|
|Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: acronym.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's how I would update `acronym.py`:
```python
import re

def abbreviate(phrase):
    words = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', phrase).split()
    return ''.join([word[0].upper() for word in words])
```

This updated version uses regular expressions (`re` module) to remove punctuation and split the phrase into words. The updated `abbreviate()` function takes a phrase, removes non-alphanumeric characters with `re.sub()`, splits it into words with `str.split()`, then returns an acronym string created by taking the first character of each word and converting it to uppercase.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in acronym.py to resolve the errors.
