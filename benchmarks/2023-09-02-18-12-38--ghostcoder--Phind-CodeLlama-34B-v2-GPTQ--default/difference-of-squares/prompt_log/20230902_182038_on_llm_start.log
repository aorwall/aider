# Instructions

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.
Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: difference_of_squares.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's how you can update `difference_of_squares.py`:
```python
def square_of_sum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2 ** 2

def sum_of_squares(n):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(1, n+1))

def difference_of_squares(n):
    return square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
```

In this updated version of the file, I have implemented the three functions as described in the instructions. The `square_of_sum` function calculates the square of the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The `sum_of_squares` function calculates the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers by iterating over the range from 1 to n+1 and squaring each number. Finally, the `difference_of_squares` function returns the difference between the result of the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in difference_of_squares.py to resolve the errors.
