The `sum_of_squares` function calculates the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers by iterating over the range from 1 to n+1 and squaring each number. Finally, the `difference_of_squares` function returns the difference between the result of the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions.",
