# Instructions

Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.

The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.
Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.
The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.
The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).

Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).
Note that all games need not be "fair".
(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)

The boards look like this:

```text
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X
```

"Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.
In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in connect.py to resolve the errors.
