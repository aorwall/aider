# Instructions

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.
It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write "the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.
You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

# Instructions append

## Python Special Instructions

A third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.
raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
