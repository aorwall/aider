### User Message
Filepath: flatten_array.py

def flatten(iterable):
    pass

```

# Instructions

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For example:

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: flatten_array.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
