Here is how I would update `flatten_array.py`:

```python
def flatten(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    
    def helper(lst):
        for i in lst:
            if type(i) == list:
                helper(i)
            else:
                if i is not None:
                    flat_list.append(i)
    
    helper(nested_list)
    return flat_list
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to iterate through each element of the inputted nested list. If an item is again a list (checked using 'type()'), it calls itself with this new sublist, thus descending into the depths of the nest. If the item isn't a list but is not null either, it gets appended to our result list (`flat_list`). The function ignores all 'None' values. 

Let me know if you need anything else!
