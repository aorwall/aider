Here is an updated version of `dnd_character.py` that follows the rules for generating a D&D character:

```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self._abilities = {
            'strength': self._roll(),
            'dexterity': self._roll(),
            'constitution': self._roll(),
            'intelligence': self._roll(),
            'wisdom': self._roll(),
            'charisma': self._roll()
        }
        
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self._calc_modifier(self._abilities['constitution'])
    
    @staticmethod
    def _roll():
        return sum(sorted([random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)])[-3:])
    
    @staticmethod
    def _calc_modifier(score):
        return (score - 10) // 2
```
In this code, we have added methods to handle rolling dice and calculating ability scores and hit points. The `_roll()` method rolls four six-sided dice, discards the lowest result, and returns the sum of the remaining three. This process is repeated five more times in the `__init__()` method to generate all six abilities. Then, it calculates the constitution modifier using the `_calc_modifier()` method, which simply subtracts 10 from the constitution score, divides by two, and rounds down. Finally, it assigns the calculated hit point total to the `hitpoints` attribute.
