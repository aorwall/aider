Because nucleic acids are\nvital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect\nthroughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very\nrare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,\nthe macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated\nresult of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.\n\nThe simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point\nmutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.\n\nBy counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands\ntaken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of\nthe minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the\nevolutionary path between the two strands.\n\nThis is called the 'Hamming distance'\n\n    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT\n    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT\n    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^\n\nThe Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.\n\n## Implementation notes\n\nThe Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you\nmay assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming\ndistance function.\n\n**Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: point_mutations.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
