Here is an updated version of the file `point_mutations.py`:

```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("DNA strands must be of same length.")
    
    return sum(el_1 != el_2 for el_1, el_2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2))
```

In this code, we first check whether both DNA strands have the same length. If they do not, a `ValueError` is raised. Then, we use a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to count the number of positions where the bases differ between the two strands. The result is the Hamming distance between them.
