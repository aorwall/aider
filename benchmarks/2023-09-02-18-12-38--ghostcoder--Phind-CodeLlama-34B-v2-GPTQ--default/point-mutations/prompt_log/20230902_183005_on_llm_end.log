To fix these issues, we need to modify our `hamming_distance` function to truncate the longer string to match the length of the shorter one before comparing them. We can do this using Python's built-in `zip()` and slicing functionality. Here is an updated version of the file `point_mutations.py`:

Filepath: point_mutations.py
```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    return sum(el_1 != el_2 for el_1, el_2 in zip(dna_strand_1[:min(len(dna_strand_1), len(dna_strand_2))], dna_strand_2[:min(len(dna_strand_1), len(dna_strand_2))]))
```
In this revised implementation, the `zip()` function combines the two DNA strands into pairs of bases up to the length of the shortest strand. Then, the generator expression counts the number of pairs where the bases differ. The result is the Hamming distance between the two strands.
