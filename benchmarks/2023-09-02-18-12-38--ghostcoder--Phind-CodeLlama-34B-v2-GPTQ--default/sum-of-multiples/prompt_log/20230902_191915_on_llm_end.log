prompt:
The issue with your original implementation was that you were adding `multiple` to `value`, even though you should have been adding `limit`. This is because we want to find all multiples of each magical item base value that are less than the level number (i.e., `limit`).

Here's the corrected version of your function:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    result = set()

    for multiple in multiples:
        value = multiple
        while value < limit:
            result.add(value)
            value += limit  # Correct this line

    return sum(result)
```
