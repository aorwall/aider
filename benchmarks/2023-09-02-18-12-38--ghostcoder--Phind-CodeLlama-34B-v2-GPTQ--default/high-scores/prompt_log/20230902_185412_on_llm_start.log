# Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)
- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's an updated version of `high_scores.py` with appropriate functionality as per your requirements:
Filepath: high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores=None):
        if scores is None:
            self.scores = []
        else:
            self.scores = scores

    def latest_score(self):
        # Returns the last added score
        return self.scores[-1] if self.scores else None

    def personal_best(self):
        # Returns the highest score from the list
        return max(self.scores) if self.scores else None

    def top_three_scores(self):
        # Returns the three highest scores
        sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
        return sorted_scores if len(sorted_scores) == 3 else None

    def add_score(self, score):
        # Add a new score to the list
        self.scores.append(score)

```

This implementation provides all required functionalities including keeping original code intact and adding new methods according to the problem statement.
