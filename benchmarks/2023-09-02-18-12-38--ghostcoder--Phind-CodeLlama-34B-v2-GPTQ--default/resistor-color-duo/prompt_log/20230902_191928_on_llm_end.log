Here's how you can update `resistor_color_duo.py`:

```python
def value(colors):
    # Define the numeric value for each color
    color_dict = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    
    # Convert the colors to numbers and calculate the value
    val = int("".join([str(color_dict[c]) for c in colors[:2]]))
    
    return val
```
This code creates a dictionary that maps color names to their numeric values. It then converts up to two of the input colors to numbers using this dictionary, concatenates them into a string, and converts that string to an integer. This gives the resistance value represented by the first two colors in the resistor.
