# Instructions

Tally the results of a small football competition.

Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:

```text
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

What do those abbreviations mean?

- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points.
A draw earns 1.
A loss earns 0.

The outcome is ordered by points, descending.
In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

## Input

Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win
```

The result of the match refers to the first team listed.
So this line:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
```

means that the Allegoric Alaskans beat the Blithering Badgers.

This line:

```text
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
```

means that the Blithering Badgers beat the Courageous Californians.

And this line:

```text
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
```

means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tournament.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is an updated version of `tournament.py` file which includes a new function named `tally`. This function reads the input data, calculates the results for each team and outputs it in the required format.
Filepath: tournament.py
```
def tally(rows):
    teams = {}

    # Process each row of data
    for row in rows:
        home_team, away_team, result = row.split(';')

        # Update stats for home team
        if home_team not in teams:
            teams[home_team] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}

        teams[home_team]['MP'] += 1
        if result == 'win':
            teams[home_team]['W'] += 1
            teams[home_team]['P'] += 3
        elif result == 'draw':
            teams[home_team]['D'] += 1
            teams[home_team]['P'] += 1
        else: # It's a loss
            teams[home_team]['L'] += 1

        # Update stats for away team
        if away_team not in teams:
            teams[away_team] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}

        teams[away_team]['MP'] += 1
        if result == 'loss':
            teams[away_team]['W'] += 1
            teams[away_team]['P'] += 3
        elif result == 'draw':
            teams[away_team]['D'] += 1
            teams[away_team]['P'] += 1
        else: # It's a win
            teams[away_team]['L'] += 1

    # Output the results sorted by points then alphabetically
    print("Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P")
    for team, stats in sorted(teams.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1]['P'], x[0])):
        print(f"{team:<32}| {stats['MP']:>2} | {stats['W']:>2} | {stats['D']:>2} | {stats['L']:>2} | {stats['P']:>2}")

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in tournament.py to resolve the errors.
