### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

# Instructions

Search files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.

The Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.
Your task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.

The `grep` command takes three arguments:

1. The string to search for.
2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.
3. One or more files to search in.

It then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.
When searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').

## Flags

The `grep` command supports the following flags:

- `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).
- `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.
- `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.
- `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grep.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here's an implementation of the `grep` function based on your specifications:
Filepath: grep.py
```
import os
import re
def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    result = []

    for file in files:
        with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf8') as f:
            lines = f.readlines()

        for lineno, line in enumerate(lines):
            if '-n' in flags:
                prefix = '{}:'.format(os.path.basename(file))
                line_number = str(lineno + 1)
                line = '{}{}:{}'.format(prefix, line_number, line)

            match = re.search(pattern, line) is not None

            if ('-i' in flags and pattern.lower() not in line.lower()) \
                    or (not match and '-v' not in flags) \
                    or (match and '-v' in flags) \
                    or (match and '-x' in flags and line != pattern):
                continue

            if '-l' in flags:
                if file not in result:
                    result.append(file)
            else:
                result.append(line.strip())

    return '
'.join(result)

```

This implementation uses Python's built-in `re` module to perform the search using regular expressions. It reads each file one line at a time, checks whether that line matches the given pattern according to the specified flags, and then either adds it to the list of results or skips it, depending on the flag settings. If the `-l` flag is used, it will only add the names of files containing matching lines to the result list.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grep.py to resolve the errors.
