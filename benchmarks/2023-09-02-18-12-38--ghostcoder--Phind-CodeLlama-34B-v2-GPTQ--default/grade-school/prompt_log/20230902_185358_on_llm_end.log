I have updated the `added` method in the School class of your grade_school.py file to fix these issues. The new implementation returns a string that combines all the grades and their respective students into one string, separating each student with a newline character. This is done by looping through the sorted grades and then the sorted students within each grade. Here's the corrected version of the `added` method:

```python
def added(self):
    return "\n".join([f"{name} in grade {grade}" for grade in sorted(self._roster) for name in sorted(self._roster[grade])])
```

With this change, the test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
