# Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think.
    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.
    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is an updated version of the `grade_school.py` file which implements the required functionality:
Filepath: grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self._roster = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if name in self._roster.get(grade, []):
            return "Student already exists in this grade."
        else:
            if grade in self._roster:
                self._roster[grade].append(name)
            else:
                self._roster[grade] = [name]
            return "OK."

    def roster(self):
        return {grade: sorted(students) for grade, students in self._roster.items()}

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self._roster:
            return sorted(self._roster[grade_number])
        else:
            return []

    def added(self):
        return "
".join([f"{name} in grade {grade}" for grade in sorted(self._roster) for name in sorted(self._roster[grade])])

```

This implementation uses a dictionary to store students by grade. The `add_student`, `roster`, `grade`, and `added` methods have been implemented according to the problem statement. 

The `add_student` method checks whether a student with the same name is already present in the given grade. If so, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it adds the student to the specified grade or creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary if the grade does not exist yet.

The `roster` method returns a copy of the entire school roster. It sorts the students' names alphabetically within each grade level using a dictionary comprehension.

The `grade` method accepts a grade number as input and returns a list of students in that grade, sorted alphabetically.

Finally, the `added` method combines all the grades and their respective students into one string, separating each student with a newline character. This is done by looping through the sorted grades and then the sorted students within each grade.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grade_school.py to resolve the errors.
