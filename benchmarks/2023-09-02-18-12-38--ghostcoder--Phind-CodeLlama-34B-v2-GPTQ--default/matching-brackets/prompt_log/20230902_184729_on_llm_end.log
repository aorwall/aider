Here's how I would approach this problem using a stack data structure:

1. Create an empty stack.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., '[', '{', or '('), push it onto the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket:
   - If the stack is empty, return False since we have an unmatched closing bracket.
   - Otherwise, check whether the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it isn't, return False.
   - If the top element is indeed the corresponding opening bracket, pop it from the stack.
5. After iterating through all characters in the input string, if the stack isn't empty, return False; otherwise, return True.

Here's what the updated code could look like:

```python
def is_paired(input_string):
    # Define a dictionary mapping closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    opening_to_closing = {'}': '{', ']': '[', ')': '('}
    
    # Initialize an empty stack
    stack = []
    
    for char in input_string:
        if char in opening_to_closing.values():  # If the current character is an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in opening_to_closing:  # If the current character is a closing bracket
            if not stack or opening_to_closing[char] != stack[-1]:  # The brackets are not matched
                return False
            else:  # The brackets are matched
                stack.pop()
                
    # At the end, the stack should be empty if all pairs were correctly closed and nested
    return len(stack) == 0
```
