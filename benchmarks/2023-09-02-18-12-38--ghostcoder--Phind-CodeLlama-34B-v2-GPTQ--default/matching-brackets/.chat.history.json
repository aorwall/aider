If the current character is a closing bracket:\n   - If the stack is empty, return False since we have an unmatched closing bracket.\n   - Otherwise, check whether the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it isn't, return False.\n   - If the top element is indeed the corresponding opening bracket, pop it from the stack.\n5. After iterating through all characters in the input string, if the stack isn't empty, return False; otherwise, return True.\n\nHere's what the updated code could look like:",
