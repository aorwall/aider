# Instructions

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

[Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is an updated version of your file with the requested function implemented:
Filepath: darts.py
```
def score(x, y):
    # Calculate the distance from the origin using Pythagorean theorem
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

    # Determine the points scored based on the distance
    if distance <= 10:
        return 10
    elif distance <= 5:
        return 5
    elif distance <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in darts.py to resolve the errors.
