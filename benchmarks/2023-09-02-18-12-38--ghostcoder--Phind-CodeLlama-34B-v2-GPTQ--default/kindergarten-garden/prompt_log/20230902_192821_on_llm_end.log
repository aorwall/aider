To fix these errors, we need to extract the plant names from the diagram based on the student's position. We can do this by iterating over each row of the diagram and slicing out the appropriate plant names. Here's an updated version of the `plants()` method that should pass the tests:

Filepath: kindergarten_garden.py
```python
def plants(self, student):
    index = self.students.index(student) % 2
    return [''.join([self.diagram[row][(col*2)+index] for col in range(2)]) for row in range(2)]
```
This implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate over each row of the garden (0 to 1), and for each row, it constructs a string by taking every other character starting at the index where the student's plants start. It then returns a list of these strings, which represent the plants belonging to the given student.
