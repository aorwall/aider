Here is an implementation of the Garden class as described by the instructions:

```python
class Garden:
    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        if students is None:
            self.students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
                              "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
                              "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"]
        else:
            self.students = sorted(students)
        
        self.diagram = diagram.split("\n")
    
    def plants(self, student):
        index = self.students.index(student) % 2
        return [plant[(row * 2 + index)*2:(row * 2 + index)*2+2] for row in range(2)]
```
This code defines a `Garden` class with an `__init__()` method that takes a garden diagram and an optional list of student names. If no student names are provided, it defaults to the original 12-student roster. The `plants()` method extracts the plants belonging to a given student based on their name and the current garden diagram.
