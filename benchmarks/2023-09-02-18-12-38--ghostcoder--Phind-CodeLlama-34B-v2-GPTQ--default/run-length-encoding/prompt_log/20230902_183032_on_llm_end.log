Here is an updated version of your encode function that should pass your tests:
Filepath: run_length_encoding.py
```python
def encode(string):
    result = ""
    current_char = None
    counter = 0

    for char in string:
        if char != current_char:
            if current_char is not None:
                result += str(counter) + current_char
            current_char = char
            counter = 1
        else:
            counter += 1

    if current_char is not None:
        result += str(counter) + current_char

    return result.strip()
```
This updated version includes a .strip() at the end of the returned result. This will remove any leading or trailing spaces which may have been added due to the encoding process.
