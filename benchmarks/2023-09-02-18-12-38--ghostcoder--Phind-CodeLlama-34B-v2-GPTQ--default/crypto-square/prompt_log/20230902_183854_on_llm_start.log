# Instructions

Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.

First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.
These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

```text
"If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."
```

is normalized to:

```text
"ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"
```

The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.
The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.

If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:

- `r * c >= length of message`,
- and `c >= r`,
- and `c - r <= 1`.

Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:

```text
"ifmanwas"
"meanttos"
"tayonthe"
"groundgo"
"dwouldha"
"vegivenu"
"sroots  "
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.

The message above is coded as:

```text
"imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"
```

Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.
For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.

```text
"imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "
```

Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:

```text
"imtgdvs"
"fearwer"
"mayoogo"
"anouuio"
"ntnnlvt"
"wttddes"
"aohghn "
"sseoau "
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is how you can update the file:
Filepath: crypto_square.py
```
def normalize_plaintext(plain_text):
    return plain_text.replace(" ", "").replace(",", "").replace(".", "").lower()

def dimensions(plain_text):
    n = len(normalize_plaintext(plain_text))
    r = int(math.sqrt(n)) if math.sqrt(n).is_integer() else int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    c = int((n / r) ** 0.5) + (1 if n % r != 0 else 0)
    return r,c

def pad_message(message, r, c):
    padded_message = message[:r*c].ljust(r*c, ' ')
    return [padded_message[i:i+c] for i in range(0, len(padded_message), c)]
def cipher_text(plain_text):
    r, c = dimensions(plain_text)
    normalized_text = normalize_plaintext(plain_text)
    matrix = pad_message(normalized_text, r, c)
    return ' '.join([''.join(row) for row in zip(*matrix)])

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in crypto_square.py to resolve the errors.
