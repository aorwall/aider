When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to \"throw\" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

Instead of sorting the records by record_id, we could create a dictionary mapping each id to its corresponding Record object. This would allow us to quickly access any record without having to iterate through the list again.\n2. We can also avoid checking if trees contains parent and child nodes repeatedly by using separate loops for creating nodes and setting their children.\n3. Lastly, I have updated the exception messages to provide more informative feedback when errors occur.",
