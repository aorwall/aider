Here is an updated version of `killer_sudoku_helper.py` with some optimizations:
Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
from itertools import combinations as c

def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    """Generate all valid combinations for a given cage"""
    
    # Filter out excluded numbers and sort the remaining ones
    available_numbers = sorted([i for i in range(1, target+1) if i not in exclude])

    # Generate all possible combinations of 'size' distinct numbers that add up to 'target'
    result = [seq for seq in c(available_numbers, size) if sum(seq) == target]

    return sorted(result)
```
This function uses Python built-in library "itertools" which provides direct way to find combinations. This implementation also assumes there are no other constraints affecting the cage besides the sum constraint.
