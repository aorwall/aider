Here is an updated version of `killer_sudoku_helper.py` that includes a function for generating combinations based on cage sum and constraints:

```python
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    """Generate all valid combinations for a given cage"""
    
    # Generate all possible combinations of 'size' numbers that add up to 'target'
    def generate_combinations(numbers, target, combination=[], total=0):
        if len(combination) == size:
            if total == target:
                yield list(combination)
        elif len(combination) < size:
            for n in numbers:
                if total + n <= target:
                    yield from generate_combinations(numbers, target, combination + [n], total + n)

    # Filter out excluded numbers and sort the remaining ones
    available_numbers = sorted([i for i in range(1, target+1) if i not in exclude])

    return sorted(list(generate_combinations(available_numbers, target)))
```
This function uses recursion to generate all possible combinations of 'size' distinct numbers that add up to 'target'. It starts with an empty combination and iteratively adds a number from 'available_numbers' to it until reaching 'size' elements. If the current total equals 'target', it yields the combination. 

Please note that this implementation assumes there are no other constraints affecting the cage besides the sum constraint.
