#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.  
####   
#### While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.  
####   
#### This is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.  
####   
#### This is one of many common variants.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a spider.  
#### It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a bird.  
#### How absurd to swallow a bird!  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cat.  
#### Imagine that, to swallow a cat!  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a dog.  
#### What a hog, to swallow a dog!  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a goat.  
#### Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cow.  
#### I don't know how she swallowed a cow!  
#### She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.  
#### She's dead, of course!

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: food_chain.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to food_chain.py:

food_chain.py
```python
animals = [
  "fly",
  "spider", 
  "bird",
  "cat",
  "dog",
  "goat",
  "cow",
  "horse"
]

reasons = [
  "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.",
  "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
  "How absurd to swallow a bird!",
  "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!",
  "What a hog, to swallow a dog!",
  "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!",
  "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!",
  "She's dead, of course!"
]

reactions = [
  "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.",
  "She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.",
  "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
  "She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.",
  "She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.",
  "She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.", 
  "She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.",
  "She swallowed the horse to catch the cow."
]

def verse(n):
  output = f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animals[n]}.\n{reasons[n]}"
  
  for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    output += f"\n{reactions[i]}"
  
  return output

def verses(start, end):
  return "\n".join([verse(i) for i in range(start, end+1)])

def sing():
  return verses(0, len(animals)-1)

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
  return verses(start_verse, end_verse)
```

This implements the song lyrics algorithmically by storing the animals, reasons, and reactions in lists and concatenating them together in the verse() and verses() functions.

food_chain.py

animals = [
  "fly",
  "spider", 
  "bird",
  "cat",
  "dog",
  "goat",
  "cow",
  "horse"
]

reasons = [
  "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.",

  "She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.",
  "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
  "She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.",
  "She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.",
  "She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.", 
  "She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.",
  "She swallowed the horse to catch the cow."
]

def verse(n):
  output = f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animals[n]}.\n{reasons[n]}"
  
  for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    output += f"\n{reactions[i]}"
  
  return output

def verses(start, end):
  return "\n".join([verse(i) for i in range(start, end)])

def sing():
  return verses(0, len(animals)-1)

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
  return verses(start_verse, end_verse-1)
```

The issue was that the `verses` function was including the `end_verse` in the range, but the `end_verse` should be exclusive based on the test cases. So I changed the `recite` function to pass `end_verse-1` to `verses`.
