#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.  
####

####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

connect.py
```python

class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.width = len(board[0])
        self.height = len(board)

    def get_winner(self):
        # Check for O winner going top to bottom
        for y in range(self.height):
            o_connected = True
            for x in range(self.width):
                if self.board[y][x] != 'O':
                    o_connected = False
                    break
            if o_connected:
                return 'O'
        
        # Check for X winner going left to right
        for x in range(self.width):
            x_connected = True
            for y in range(self.height):
                if self.board[y][x] != 'X':
                    x_connected = False
                    break
            if x_connected:
                return 'X'
        
        # No winner
        return None
```

I made the following changes:

- Added initialization code to store the board and its dimensions
- Implemented get_winner() by looping through the rows and columns to check for 'O' and 'X' connections
- Return 'O' if 'O' is connected top to bottom
- Return 'X' if 'X' is connected left to right  
- Return None if there is no winner

The full file content is included to avoid omitting any existing code. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!

connect.py
```python

class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.width = len(board[0])
        self.height = len(board)

    def get_winner(self):
        # Check for O winner going top to bottom
        for y in range(self.height):
            o_connected = True

                if self.board[y][x] != 'O':

                return 'O'
        
        # Check for X winner going left to right
        for x in range(self.width):
            x_connected = True
            for y in range(self.height):
                if self.board[y][x] != 'X':
                    x_connected = False
                    break
            if x_connected:
                return 'X'

        # Check for O winner going left to right
        for x in range(self.width):
            o_connected = True
            for y in range(self.height):
                if self.board[y][x] != 'O':
                    o_connected = False
                    break
            if o_connected:
                return 'O'

        # Check for X winner going top to bottom
        for y in range(self.height):
            x_connected = True
            for x in range(self.width):
                if self.board[y][x] != 'X':
                    x_connected = False
                    break
            if x_connected:
                return 'X'
        
        # No winner
        return None
```

The changes check for 'O' winner going left to right and 'X' winner going top to bottom in addition to the original checks. This should fix the issues seen in the test failures.
