#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You are starting a secret coding club with some friends and friends-of-friends.  
#### Not everyone knows each other, so you and your friends have decided to create a secret handshake that you can use to recognize that someone is a member.  
#### You don't want anyone who isn't in the know to be able to crack the code.  
####   
#### You've designed the code so that one person says a number between 1 and 31, and the other person turns it into a series of actions.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to convert a number between 1 and 31 to a sequence of actions in the secret handshake.  
####   
#### The sequence of actions is chosen by looking at the rightmost five digits of the number once it's been converted to binary.  
#### Start at the right-most digit and move left.  
####   
#### The actions for each number place are:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### 00001 = wink  
#### 00010 = double blink  
#### 00100 = close your eyes  
#### 01000 = jump  
#### 10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Let's use the number `9` as an example:  
####   
#### - 9 in binary is `1001`.  
#### - The digit that is farthest to the right is 1, so the first action is `wink`.  
#### - Going left, the next digit is 0, so there is no double-blink.  
#### - Going left again, the next digit is 0, so you leave your eyes open.  
#### - Going left again, the next digit is 1, so you jump.  
####   
#### That was the last digit, so the final code is:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### wink, jump  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given the number 26, which is `11010` in binary, we get the following actions:  
####   
#### - double blink  
#### - jump  
#### - reverse actions  
####   
#### The secret handshake for 26 is therefore:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### jump, double blink  
#### ```  
####

#### ~~~~  
#### To keep things simple (and to let you focus on the important part of this exercise), your function will receive its inputs as binary strings:  
####   
#### ```  
#### >>> commands("00011")  
#### ["wink", "double blink"]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: secret_handshake.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to secret_handshake.py:

secret_handshake.py
```python
def commands(binary_str):
    actions = []
    if binary_str[-1] == '1':
        actions.append('wink')
    if binary_str[-2] == '1':
        actions.append('double blink')
    if binary_str[-3] == '1':
        actions.append('close your eyes')
    if binary_str[-4] == '1':
        actions.append('jump')
    if binary_str[-5] == '1':
        actions.reverse()
    return actions
```
