#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a year, report if it is a leap year.  
####   
#### The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### on every year that is evenly divisible by 4  
####   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100  
####     unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  
#### 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!  
####   
#### For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].  
####

####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

leap.py
```python
def leap_year(year):
  if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
      if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
      else:
        return False
    else:
      return True
  else:
    return False
```

I have implemented the leap year logic as described in the instructions within the leap_year function.

The function first checks if the year is divisible by 4. If so, it then checks if the year is divisible by 100. If the year is divisible by 100, it further checks if the year is divisible by 400. Based on these checks it returns True if it is a leap year, False otherwise.

This implements the logic that a leap year occurs on every year divisible by 4, except years divisible by 100, but still occurs on years divisible by 400.
