#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a² + b² = c²  
#### ```  
####   
#### and such that,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a < b < c  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 3² + 4² = 5².  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.  
####   
#### For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### *NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pythagorean_triplet.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

pythagorean_triplet.py
```python
def triplets_with_sum(number):
  triplets = []

  for a in range(1, number):
    for b in range(a + 1, number): 
      c = number - a - b
      if a*a + b*b == c*c:
        triplets.append([a, b, c])

  return triplets
```

#### Tests timed out!  
#### ####  
####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct.  
#### Fix the code in pythagorean_triplet.py to resolve the errors.  

pythagorean_triplet.py
```python
def triplets_with_sum(number):
  triplets = []

  for a in range(1, number//3 + 1):
    for b in range(a + 1, number//2 + 1):
      c = number - a - b
      if a*a + b*b == c*c:
        triplets.append([a, b, c])

  return triplets
```

The key changes:

- Loop bounds were too high, causing timeout for large inputs. Reduced upper bounds on a and b.
- Integer division // used to avoid slow float math.

This fixes the timeout errors by reducing the search space.
