#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.  
####   
#### An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).  
####   
#### The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:  
####   
#### - eggs (1)  
#### - peanuts (2)  
#### - shellfish (4)  
#### - strawberries (8)  
#### - tomatoes (16)  
#### - chocolate (32)  
#### - pollen (64)  
#### - cats (128)  
####   
#### So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.  
####   
#### Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:  
####   
#### - Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.  
#### - All the allergens Tom is allergic to.  
####   
#### Note: a given score may include allergens **not** listed above (i.e.  allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.).  
#### Your program should ignore those components of the score.  
#### For example, if the allergy score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: allergies.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated allergies.py file:

allergies.py
```python
allergens = {
  1: 'eggs',
  2: 'peanuts',
  4: 'shellfish',
  8: 'strawberries',
  16: 'tomatoes',
  32: 'chocolate',
  64: 'pollen',
  128: 'cats'
}

class Allergies:

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score
        self.allergies = []
        for allergen_score, allergen in allergens.items():
            if score & allergen_score:
                self.allergies.append(allergen)

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        return item in self.allergies

    @property
    def lst(self):
        return self.allergies
```

The key changes:

- Added a dictionary mapping allergen scores to allergen names
- Initialize self.allergies in __init__ by checking score against each allergen score 
- Implemented allergic_to() to check if item is in self.allergies list
- Implemented lst property to return self.allergies list

This implements the allergy score decoding and checks based on the instructions provided. Let me know if you have any other questions!
