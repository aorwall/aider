#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.  
####   
#### A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  
####   
#### Note that 1 is not a prime number.  
####   
#### ## Example  
####   
#### What are the prime factors of 60?  
####   
#### - Our first divisor is 2.  
####   2 goes into 60, leaving 30.  
#### - 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.  
####   - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.  
####     So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.  
#### - 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.  
####   - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 4.  
####   - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 5.  
#### - 5 does go cleanly into 5.  
#### - We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.  
####   
#### Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.  
####   
#### You can check this yourself:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 2 * 2 * 3 * 5  
#### = 4 * 15  
#### = 60  
#### ```  
####   
#### Success!  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: prime_factors.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

prime_factors.py
```python
def factors(value):
  factors = []
  
  # Keep dividing value by numbers from 2 up
  # Append each number that divides cleanly into factors
  # Stop when we can no longer divide by anything
  
  i = 2
  while i <= value:
    if value % i == 0:
      factors.append(i)
      value = value / i
    else:
      i += 1
      
  return factors
```
