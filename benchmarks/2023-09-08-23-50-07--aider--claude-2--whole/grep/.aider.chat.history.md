#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Search files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.  
####   
#### The Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.  
#### Your task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.  
####   
#### The `grep` command takes three arguments:  
####   
#### 1. The string to search for.  
#### 2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.  
#### 3. One or more files to search in.  
####   
#### It then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.  
#### When searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').  
####   
#### ## Flags  
####   
#### The `grep` command supports the following flags:  
####   
#### - `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).  
#### - `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.  
#### - `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.  
#### - `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.  
#### - `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.  
####   
#### [grep]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grep.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to implement the grep command:

grep.py
```python
import re

def grep(pattern, flags, files):

    regex_flags = 0
    if '-i' in flags:
        regex_flags |= re.IGNORECASE

    match_entire_line = '-x' in flags
    invert_match = '-v' in flags
    show_line_numbers = '-n' in flags
    show_file_names = '-l' not in flags

    matches = []
    for filename in files:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            line_num = 0
            for line in f:
                line_num += 1
                if match_entire_line:
                    is_match = line.strip() == pattern
                else:
                    is_match = re.search(pattern, line, regex_flags) is not None
                if is_match and not invert_match or not is_match and invert_match:
                    if show_line_numbers:
                        line = f'{filename}:{line_num}: {line}'
                    elif show_file_names:
                        line = f'{filename}: {line}'
                    matches.append(line)

    if show_file_names:
        return set(matches)
    return matches
```

The key changes:
- Import re to support regex matching
- Add flags to control case-insensitive search, line number prefix, etc 
- Open each file and search line-by-line
- Use re.search to find matches, with support for full line matches
- Collect matches based on invert flag
- Prefix file name and/or line number if needed
- Return list of matches or set of file names

This implements the required grep functionality using native Python libraries. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!

            line_num = 0
            for line in f:
                line_num += 1
                if match_entire_line:
                    is_match = line.strip() == pattern
                else:
                    is_match = re.search(pattern, line, regex_flags) is not None
                if is_match and not invert_match or not is_match and invert_match:
                    if show_line_numbers:
                        line = f'{filename}:{line_num}: {line}'
                    elif show_file_names:
                        line = f'{filename}: {line}'
                    matches.append(line)

    if show_file_names:
        return set(matches)
    return '\n'.join(matches)
```

The key changes:
- Return a set if show_file_names flag is used
- Otherwise join the matches into a string with newlines and return that

This resolves the test failures by returning the expected types.
