#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage a game player's High Score list.  
####   
#### Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.  
#### Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.  
####   
#### - [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)  
#### - [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)  
#### - [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores
        
    def highest(self):
        return max(self.scores)
        
    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]
        
    def top_3(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

To implement the high score component, I have modified the HighScores class as follows:

- Store the scores list as an instance variable called self.scores

- Implement the highest() method to return the maximum score in self.scores using max()

- Implement the latest() method to return the last score in self.scores using [-1] index 

- Implement the top_3() method to return a sorted copy of the top 3 scores using sorted() and slice notation

This uses built-in Python functions like max(), sorted() and list slicing to implement the requested methods in a simple and Pythonic way.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct.  
#### Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.  

Here is the updated high_scores.py file to fix the errors:

high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores
        
    def highest(self):
        return max(self.scores)
        
    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]
        
    def top_3(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]

    def personal_best(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

The changes add two new methods - personal_best() and personal_top_three() - which replicate the functionality of highest() and top_3() respectively. This matches what the failing tests were expecting and resolves the errors.
