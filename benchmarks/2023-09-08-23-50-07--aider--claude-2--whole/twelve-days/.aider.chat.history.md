#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Test-driven development  
####   
####  Be sure to check the comments at the top of the tests file.  
####  They will be helpful in understanding the expected output of your function.  
####   
#### This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.  
#### However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.  
#### For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.  
#### For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.  
#### What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?  
####   
#### [cumulative song]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve_days.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to implement "The Twelve Days of Christmas" song lyrics:

twelve_days.py
```python
GIFTS = [
    "a Partridge in a Pear Tree",
    "two Turtle Doves",
    "three French Hens",
    "four Calling Birds",
    "five Gold Rings",
    "six Geese-a-Laying",
    "seven Swans-a-Swimming",
    "eight Maids-a-Milking",
    "nine Ladies Dancing",
    "ten Lords-a-Leaping",
    "eleven Pipers Piping",
    "twelve Drummers Drumming"
]

DAYS = [
    "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", 
    "seventh", "eighth", "ninth", "tenth", "eleventh", "twelfth"
]

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    lyrics = []
    for verse in range(start_verse, end_verse+1):
        lyric = f"On the {DAYS[verse-1]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
        gifts = GIFTS[verse-1:0:-1]
        lyric += ", ".join(gifts) + "."
        lyrics.append(lyric)
    return lyrics
```

This implements the song by separating the changing gift and day into lists, and assembling each verse lyric by looping through the verses.

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    lyrics = []
    for verse in range(start_verse, end_verse+1):
        lyric = f"On the {DAYS[verse-1]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
        gifts = GIFTS[verse-1::-1] # reverse gifts
        gifts_lyric = ", ".join(gifts)
        lyric += gifts_lyric + "."
        lyrics.append(lyric)
    return lyrics
```

The issue was that the gifts were being sliced in the wrong order. Reversing the gifts list for each verse fixes it.
