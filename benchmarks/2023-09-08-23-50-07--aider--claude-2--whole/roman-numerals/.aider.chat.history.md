#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.  
####   
#### The Romans were a clever bunch.  
#### They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  
#### They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.  
#### One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.  
#### This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
#### For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.  
####   
#### The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
#### (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  => I  
#### 10  => X  
####  7  => VII  
#### ```  
####   
#### The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.  
#### (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)  
####   
#### Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.  
####   
#### To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.  
####   
#### In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:  
####   
#### 1000=M  
#### 900=CM  
#### 90=XC  
####   
#### 2008 is written as MMVIII:  
####   
#### 2000=MM  
#### 8=VIII  
####   
#### Learn more about [Roman numerals on Wikipedia][roman-numerals].  
####   
#### [roman-numerals]: https://wiki.imperivm-romanvm.com/wiki/Roman_Numerals  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to implement Roman numeral conversion in roman_numerals.py:

roman_numerals.py
```python
def roman(number):

  roman_numerals = {1000:'M', 900:'CM', 500:'D', 400:'CD', 100:'C', 90:'XC', 50:'L', 40:'XL', 10:'X', 9:'IX', 5:'V', 4:'IV', 1:'I'}

  result = ''
  for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():
    while number >= value:
      result += numeral
      number -= value

  return result

```

The changes implement a roman numeral conversion by:

- Defining a dictionary mapping numeric values to their Roman numeral equivalents
- Initializing a result string
- Iterating through the dictionary, greedily subtracting the largest value less than the input number and appending the corresponding numeral to the result 
- Returning the final Roman numeral result

This implements Roman numeral conversion using the standard digit-by-digit subtraction approach, while avoiding the need for complex logic. By greedily subtracting the largest possible values, it generates the numeral using the fewest characters needed.
