#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
#### For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!  
####   
#### The band colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### From the example above:  
#### brown-green should return 15  
#### brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_duo.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to implement the resistor color code program:

resistor_color_duo.py
```python
COLOR_CODE = {
    'black': 0,
    'brown': 1,
    'red': 2,
    'orange': 3,
    'yellow': 4,
    'green': 5,
    'blue': 6,
    'violet': 7,
    'grey': 8,
    'white': 9
}

def value(colors):
    return COLOR_CODE[colors[0]] * 10 + COLOR_CODE[colors[1]]
```

The changes:

- Define a COLOR_CODE dictionary mapping color names to numeric values
- Implement the value() function to:
  - Lookup the first color in COLOR_CODE to get the tens digit
  - Lookup the second color in COLOR_CODE to get the ones digit 
  - Return the tens digit multiplied by 10 plus the ones digit

This implements the resistor color value calculation based on the instructions provided.
