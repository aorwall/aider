#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### ![Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/darts/darts-scoreboard.svg)  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to darts.py:

darts.py
```python
import math

def score(x, y):
  distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
  
  if distance > 10:
    return 0
  elif distance > 5: 
    return 1 
  elif distance > 1:
    return 5
  else:
    return 10
```

> Applied edit to darts.py  
```
