#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]

#### ## Customizing and Raising Exceptions  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.   
####   
#### Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).  
####   
#### For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you create two _custom exceptions_.  One exception to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your circular buffer is **full**, and one for when it is **empty**. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.  
####   
#### To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # subclassing the built-in BufferError to create BufferFullException  
#### class BufferFullException(BufferError):  
####     """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is full.  
####   
####     message: explanation of the error.  
####   
####     """  
####     def __init__(self, message):  
####         self.message = message  
####   
####           
#### # raising a BufferFullException  
#### raise BufferFullException("Circular buffer is full")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to circular_buffer.py:

circular_buffer.py
```python
class BufferFullException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is full.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message


class BufferEmptyException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is empty.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message


class CircularBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = [None] * capacity
        self.head = 0
        self.tail = 0
        self.size = 0

    def read(self):
        if self.size == 0:
            raise BufferEmptyException("Circular buffer is empty")
        
        value = self.buffer[self.head]
        self.head = (self.head + 1) % self.capacity
        self.size -= 1
        return value

    def write(self, data):
        if self.size == self.capacity:
            raise BufferFullException("Circular buffer is full")
            
        self.buffer[self.tail] = data
        self.tail = (self.tail + 1) % self.capacity
        self.size += 1

    def overwrite(self, data):
        if self.size == self.capacity:
            self.buffer[self.head] = data
            self.head = (self.head + 1) % self.capacity
        else:
            self.write(data)

    def clear(self):
        self.head = 0
        self.tail = 0
        self.size = 0
```

The key changes are:
- Defining BufferFullException and BufferEmptyException classes that inherit from BufferError
- Raising these custom exceptions with messages in read() and write()
- Implementing the circular buffer logic to track size, head and tail
