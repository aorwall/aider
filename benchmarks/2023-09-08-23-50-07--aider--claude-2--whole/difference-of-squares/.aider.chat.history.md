#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.  
####   
#### The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.  
####   
#### The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.  
####   
#### Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.  
####   
#### You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.  
#### Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: difference_of_squares.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
