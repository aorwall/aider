#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.  
#### They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.  
#### To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.  
#### You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".  
####   
#### The best known English pangram is:

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.  
####   
#### A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.  
#### It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).  
####   
#### For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the suggested changes to pangram.py:

pangram.py
```python
import string

def is_pangram(sentence):
    letters = set(sentence.lower())
    return set(string.ascii_lowercase) <= letters
```

The changes check if the lowercase letters in the sentence contain all letters a-z by:

- Converting sentence to lowercase 
- Getting unique letters in sentence as a set
- Comparing that to a set of all letters a-z
- Returning True if the sentence letters contain all letters

This avoids needing to explicitly check for each letter, and handles duplicates.
