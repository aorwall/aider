#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.  
#### A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.  
####   
#### Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.  
####   
#### The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).  
#### Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.  
#### The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).  
#### Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.  
####   
#### Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `anagram.py` is just a function stub. We need to implement the `find_anagrams` function according to the given instructions. Here's the updated code:

anagram.py
```
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    anagrams = []
    target = sorted(word.lower())
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        if sorted(candidate.lower()) == target and candidate.lower() != word.lower():
            anagrams.append(candidate)
    
    return anagrams
```

In the updated code, we iterate over each candidate word and check if it is an anagram of the target word. We convert both the target word and candidate word to lowercase and sort their characters. If the sorted characters are equal and the candidate word is not the same as the target word, we add it to the `anagrams` list.

This implementation ensures that the anagram set contains words with the same letter case as in the candidate set.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
