#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.  
####   
#### The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.  
####   
#### The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.  
####   
#### Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.  
####   
#### You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.  
#### Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

The current code in `difference_of_squares.py` does not implement any functionality. To calculate the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers, we need to update the code.

Here's the updated code for `difference_of_squares.py`:

difference_of_squares.py
```
def square_of_sum(number):
    # Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers
    sum_of_numbers = sum(range(1, number + 1))

    # Square the sum
    square_of_sum = sum_of_numbers ** 2

    return square_of_sum


def sum_of_squares(number):
    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers
    sum_of_squares = sum([i ** 2 for i in range(1, number + 1)])

    return sum_of_squares


def difference_of_squares(number):
    # Calculate the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares
    diff = square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number)

    return diff
```

In the updated code:
- The `square_of_sum` function calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers and then squares the sum.
- The `sum_of_squares` function calculates the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.
- The `difference_of_squares` function calls the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions to calculate the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares.

These changes will allow the code to correctly calculate the desired difference.
