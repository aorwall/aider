#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

The current code in `darts.py` is just a function stub for the `score` function. We need to implement the logic to calculate the earned points based on the given coordinates.

Here's the updated code for `darts.py`:

darts.py
```
def score(x, y):
    distance = (x ** 2 + y ** 2) ** 0.5

    if distance > 10:
        return 0
    elif distance > 5:
        return 1
    elif distance > 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
```

In this updated code, we calculate the distance of the given point `(x, y)` from the origin `(0, 0)` using the distance formula. Based on the distance, we determine the earned points according to the rules mentioned in the instructions.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
