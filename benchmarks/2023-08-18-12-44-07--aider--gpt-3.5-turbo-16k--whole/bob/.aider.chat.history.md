#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.  
#### He likes to think that he's very cool.  
#### And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.  
#### That wouldn't be cool.  
####   
#### When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.  
####   
#### Bob only ever answers one of five things:  
####   
#### - **"Sure."**  
####   This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"  
####   The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.  
#### - **"Whoa, chill out!"**  
####   This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.  
####   The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  
#### - **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**  
####   This is what he says if you yell a question at him.  
#### - **"Fine. Be that way!"**  
####   This is how he responds to silence.  
####   The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.  
#### - **"Whatever."**  
####   This is what he answers to anything else.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `bob.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To implement the desired behavior, we need to modify the `response` function to check the input and return the appropriate response based on the given instructions.

Here's the updated code for `bob.py`:

bob.py
```
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.endswith('?'):
        return "Sure."
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        if hey_bob.endswith('?'):
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else:
            return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif not hey_bob.strip():
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```

In the updated code:
- We check if the input ends with a question mark (`?`) to determine if it's a question. If it is, we return "Sure."
- We check if the input is in all uppercase letters to determine if it's yelling. If it is, we check if it ends with a question mark (`?`). If it does, we return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!". Otherwise, we return "Whoa, chill out!"
- We check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters to determine if it's silence. If it is, we return "Fine. Be that way!"
- If none of the above conditions are met, we return "Whatever."

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Based on the testing errors, it seems that the code in `bob.py` is not producing the expected responses for certain inputs. 

To fix the errors, we need to make the following changes:

1. Update the condition for checking if the input ends with a question mark. Currently, it is checking if the input ends with a question mark and is in uppercase. However, the requirement is to check if the input ends with a question mark and is not in all uppercase. We can use the `isupper()` method to check if the input is in all uppercase.

2. Add a condition to check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters. Currently, the code is checking if the input is not empty or contains only whitespace characters. We need to change this condition to check if the input is empty or contains only whitespace characters.

Here is the updated code for `bob.py`:

bob.py
```
def response(hey_bob):
    if hey_bob.endswith('?') and not hey_bob.isupper():
        return "Sure."
    elif hey_bob.isupper():
        if hey_bob.endswith('?'):
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else:
            return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif not hey_bob.strip():
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```

Please replace the content of `bob.py` with the updated code.
