#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.  
####   
#### An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.  
####   
#### Examples of isograms:  
####   
#### - lumberjacks  
#### - background  
#### - downstream  
#### - six-year-old  
####   
#### The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `isogram.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To determine if a word or phrase is an isogram, we need to check if any letter in the word or phrase is repeated, excluding spaces and hyphens.

Here's an updated version of `isogram.py` with the implementation of the `is_isogram` function:

isogram.py
```
def is_isogram(string):
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()

    # Create a set to store the unique letters in the string
    letters = set()

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in string:
        # Ignore spaces and hyphens
        if char != ' ' and char != '-':
            # If the character is already in the set, it is a repeated letter
            if char in letters:
                return False
            # Add the character to the set
            letters.add(char)

    # If no repeated letters are found, it is an isogram
    return True
```

This implementation checks each character in the string and adds it to a set if it is not a space or hyphen. If a character is already in the set, it means it is a repeated letter and the function returns `False`. If no repeated letters are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is an isogram.
