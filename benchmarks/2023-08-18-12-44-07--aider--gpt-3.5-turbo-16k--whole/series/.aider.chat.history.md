#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.  
####   
#### For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:  
####   
#### - "491"  
#### - "914"  
#### - "142"  
####   
#### And the following 4-digit series:  
####   
#### - "4914"  
#### - "9142"  
####   
#### And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.  
####   
#### Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;  
#### the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the slice length is zero.  
#### raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")  
####   
#### # if the slice length is negative.  
#### raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")  
####   
#### # if the series provided is empty.  
#### raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")  
####   
#### # if the slice length is longer than the series.  
#### raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
