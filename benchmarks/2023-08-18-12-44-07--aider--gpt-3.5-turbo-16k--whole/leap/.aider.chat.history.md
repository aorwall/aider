#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a year, report if it is a leap year.  
####   
#### The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### on every year that is evenly divisible by 4  
####   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100  
####     unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  
#### 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!  
####   
#### For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `leap.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To implement the leap year logic, we can modify the code as follows:

leap.py
```
def leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False
```

In the updated code, we check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, we further check if it is divisible by 100. If it is divisible by 100, we check if it is also divisible by 400. If it is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. If it is not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

This implementation follows the rules mentioned in the instructions for determining a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
