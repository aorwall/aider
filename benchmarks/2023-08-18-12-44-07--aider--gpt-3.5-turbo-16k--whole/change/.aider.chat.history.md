#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.  
####   
#### ## For example  
####   
#### - An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10]  
#### - An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]  
####   
#### ## Edge cases  
####   
#### - Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?  
#### - Can you ask for negative change?  
#### - Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in  
#### raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: change.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. To correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given as change, we need to implement the logic in the `find_fewest_coins` function.

Here's the updated code for `change.py`:

change.py
```
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Change value cannot be negative")
    
    dp = [float('inf')] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Cannot make target with given coins")
    
    result = []
    i = target
    while i > 0:
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0 and dp[i] == dp[i - coin] + 1:
                result.append(coin)
                i -= coin
                break
    
    return result
```

In this updated code:
- We first check if the target value is negative and raise a `ValueError` if it is.
- We use dynamic programming to find the fewest number of coins needed to make the target value.
- We initialize a list `dp` with `float('inf')` values to represent the minimum number of coins needed for each value from 0 to the target value.
- We set `dp[0]` to 0 since no coins are needed to make a change of 0.
- We iterate through each coin and update the `dp` list by considering the current coin and the previous values in `dp`.
- After finding the minimum number of coins needed for the target value, we check if it is still `float('inf')`, which means it is not possible to make the target value with the given coins. In that case, we raise a `ValueError`.
- If it is possible to make the target value, we backtrack from the target value to find the coins used. We start from the target value and check which coin was used to reach that value. We append that coin to the result list and subtract its value from the current value. We repeat this process until we reach 0.
- Finally, we return the result list containing the fewest number of coins needed to make the target value.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
