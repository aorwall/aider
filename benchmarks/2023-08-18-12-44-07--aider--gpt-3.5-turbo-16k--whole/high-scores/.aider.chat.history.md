#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage a game player's High Score list.  
####   
#### Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.  
#### Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.  
####   
#### - [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)  
#### - [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)  
#### - [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `high_scores.py` is just a class stub with an empty `__init__` method. To implement the required functionality, we need to add methods to the `HighScores` class that return the highest score, the last added score, and the three highest scores.

Here's the updated code for `high_scores.py`:

high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def highest(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

I have added three methods to the `HighScores` class:
- `highest`: This method returns the highest score from the list by using the `max` function.
- `latest`: This method returns the last added score by accessing the last element of the `scores` list using the index `[-1]`.
- `top_three`: This method returns the three highest scores from the list by sorting the `scores` list in descending order and then returning the first three elements using slicing `[:3]`.

These methods should provide the required functionality for managing the high scores.

It seems that the test cases are expecting methods `personal_best()` and `personal_top_three()` to be implemented in the `HighScores` class. However, these methods are not defined in the provided code.

To fix the errors, you need to implement the missing methods in the `HighScores` class. Here's the updated code:

high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def highest(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]

    def personal_best(self):
        return self.highest()

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return self.top_three()
```

Please replace the content of the `high_scores.py` file with the updated code above. This should resolve the errors in the test cases.
