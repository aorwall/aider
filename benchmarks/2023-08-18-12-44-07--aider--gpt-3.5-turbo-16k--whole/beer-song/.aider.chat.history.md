Based on the testing errors, it seems that the expected output for the beer song lyrics is not matching the actual output. The issue seems to be with the handling of the last verse when there is only 1 bottle of beer left.

To fix this, we need to update the code in `beer_song.py` to handle the special case when there is only 1 bottle of beer left. Currently, it is using the condition `elif i == 1` to handle this case, but it is not producing the correct output.

Here is the updated code for `beer_song.py`:

beer_song.py
```
def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, start - take, -1):
        if i > 2:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} bottles of beer on the wall, {i} bottles of beer.")
            lyrics.append(f"Take one down and pass it around, {i-1} bottles of beer on the wall.")
        elif i == 2:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} bottles of beer on the wall, {i} bottles of beer.")
            lyrics.append(f"Take one down and pass it around, {i-1} bottle of beer on the wall.")
        elif i == 1:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} bottle of beer on the wall, {i} bottle of beer.")
            lyrics.append("Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.")
        else:
            lyrics.append("No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.")
            lyrics.append("Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.")
    return lyrics
```

Please replace the content of `beer_song.py` with the updated code above. This should resolve the testing errors.
