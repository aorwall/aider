#### # Instructions  
####   
#### For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.  
#### This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.  
#### These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.  
#### You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.  
#### You do this six times, once for each ability.  
####   
#### Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.  
#### You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.  
####   
#### Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.  
####   
#### For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:  
####   
#### - 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.  
#### - 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.  
#### - 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.  
#### - 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.  
#### - 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.  
#### - 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.  
####   
#### Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.  
#### One such language is [Troll][troll].

The current code in `dnd_character.py` is just a class stub with an empty `__init__` method. We need to implement the random character generator according to the given instructions.

Here's the updated code for `dnd_character.py`:

dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability()
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.get_modifier(self.constitution)

    def roll_ability(self):
        dice_rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        dice_rolls.sort()
        return sum(dice_rolls[1:])

    def get_modifier(self, ability_score):
        return (ability_score - 10) // 2
```

In the updated code:
- We import the `random` module to generate random dice rolls.
- The `Character` class now has an `__init__` method that initializes the character's abilities and hitpoints.
- The `roll_ability` method generates four random dice rolls, sorts them in ascending order, and sums the largest three rolls to get the ability score.
- The `get_modifier` method calculates the ability modifier based on the ability score.

With these changes, the `Character` class will generate random abilities and hitpoints according to the given rules.

Apologies for the confusion. It seems that there is an error in the code that is causing the import issue. Let's take a look at the code and fix the issue.

Here is the updated content of the file:

dnd_character.py
```
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability()
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.get_modifier(self.constitution)

    def roll_ability(self):
        dice_rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        dice_rolls.sort()
        return sum(dice_rolls[1:])

    def get_modifier(self, ability_score):
        return (ability_score - 10) // 2
```

Please try running the tests again and let me know if the issue is resolved.
