#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Reparent a tree on a selected node.  
####   
#### A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.  
#### That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.  
####   
#### This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.  
#### For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     +------0------+  
####     |      |      |  
####   +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+  
####   |   |  |   |  |   |  
####   4   5  6   7  8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### But there is no inherent direction in a tree.  
#### The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.  
#### So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:  
####   
#### ```text  
####         6  
####         |  
####   +-----2-----+  
####   |           |  
####   7     +-----0-----+  
####         |           |  
####       +-1-+       +-3-+  
####       |   |       |   |  
####       4   5       8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.  
#### So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.  
####   
#### This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV  
#### raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")  
####   
#### #when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.  
#### raise ValueError("No path found")  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the error messages, it seems that the `from_pov` method in the `Tree` class is returning `None` instead of a `Tree` object. To fix this issue, we need to implement the logic for the `from_pov` method.

Here's the updated code for the `from_pov` method:

```python
def from_pov(self, from_node):
    if self.label == from_node:
        return self

    for child in self.children:
        result = child.from_pov(from_node)
        if result is not None:
            result.children.append(self)
            return result

    return None
```

Please replace the existing code in the `pov.py` file with the updated code above.
