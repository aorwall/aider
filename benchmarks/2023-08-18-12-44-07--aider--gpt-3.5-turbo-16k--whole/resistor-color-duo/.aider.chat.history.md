#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
#### For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!  
####   
#### The band colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### From the example above:  
#### brown-green should return 15  
#### brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_duo.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `resistor_color_duo.py` is just a function stub with no implementation. We need to implement the `value` function according to the given instructions.

Here's the updated code for `resistor_color_duo.py`:

resistor_color_duo.py
```
def value(colors):
    color_values = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    # Get the first two colors from the input
    first_color = colors[0]
    second_color = colors[1]

    # Get the corresponding values for the first two colors
    first_value = color_values[first_color]
    second_value = color_values[second_color]

    # Combine the values to get the final result
    result = int(str(first_value) + str(second_value))

    return result
```

The updated code defines a dictionary `color_values` that maps each color to its corresponding value. It then retrieves the first two colors from the input and looks up their values in the dictionary. Finally, it combines the values to get the final result.

This implementation should correctly handle the given requirements.
