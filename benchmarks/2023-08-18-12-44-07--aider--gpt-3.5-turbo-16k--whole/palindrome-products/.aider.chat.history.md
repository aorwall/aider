#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Detect palindrome products in a given range.  
####   
#### A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.  
#### For example, `121` is a palindromic number but `112` is not.  
####   
#### Given a range of numbers, find the largest and smallest palindromes which  
#### are products of two numbers within that range.  
####   
#### Your solution should return the largest and smallest palindromes, along with the factors of each within the range.  
#### If the largest or smallest palindrome has more than one pair of factors within the range, then return all the pairs.  
####   
#### ## Example 1  
####   
#### Given the range `[1, 9]` (both inclusive)...  
####   
#### And given the list of all possible products within this range:  
#### `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 15, 21, 24, 27, 20, 28, 32, 36, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 42, 48, 54, 49, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81]`  
####   
#### The palindrome products are all single digit numbers (in this case):  
#### `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  
####   
#### The smallest palindrome product is `1`.  
#### Its factors are `(1, 1)`.  
#### The largest palindrome product is `9`.  
#### Its factors are `(1, 9)` and `(3, 3)`.  
####   
#### ## Example 2  
####   
#### Given the range `[10, 99]` (both inclusive)...  
####   
#### The smallest palindrome product is `121`.  
#### Its factors are `(11, 11)`.  
#### The largest palindrome product is `9009`.  
#### Its factors are `(91, 99)`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Notes regarding the implementation of `smallest` and `largest`:  
####   
#### Both functions must take two keyword arguments:  
#### - `max_factor`: int  
#### - `min_factor`: int, default 0  
####   
#### Their return value must be a `tuple -- (value, factors)` where `value` is the  
#### palindrome itself, and `factors` is an `iterable` containing both factors of the  
#### palindrome in arbitrary order.  
####   
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `largest()` or `smallest()` function receives a pair of factors that are not in the correct range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the max_factor is less than the min_factor  
#### raise ValueError("min must be <= max")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: palindrome_products.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
