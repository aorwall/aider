#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed.  
#### All known life depends on DNA!  
####   
#### > Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.  
####   
#### DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.  
#### A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!  
#### We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".  
####   
#### We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.  
#### 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.  
####   
#### Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.  
#### If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2  
#### "INVALID" -> error  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nucleotide_count.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
