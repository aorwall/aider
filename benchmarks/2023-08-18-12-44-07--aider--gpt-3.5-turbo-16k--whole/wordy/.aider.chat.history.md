#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 0 — Numbers  
####   
#### Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.  
####   
#### > What is 5?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 5.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 1 — Addition  
####   
#### Add two numbers together.  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 18.  
####   
#### Handle large numbers and negative numbers.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division  
####   
#### Now, perform the other three operations.  
####   
#### > What is 7 minus 5?  
####   
#### 2  
####   
#### > What is 6 multiplied by 4?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 25 divided by 5?  
####   
#### 5  
####   
#### ## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations  
####   
#### Handle a set of operations, in sequence.  
####   
#### Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?  
####   
#### 15  (i.e. not 9)  
####   
#### ## Iteration 4 — Errors  
####   
#### The parser should reject:  
####   
#### - Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")  
#### - Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")  
#### - Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the question contains an unknown operation.  
#### raise ValueError("unknown operation")  
####   
#### # if the question is malformed or invalid.  
#### raise ValueError("syntax error")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
