#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.  
#### If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.  
####   
#### [classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a class stub with empty methods. We need to implement the functionality according to the given instructions. Here's the updated code:

grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roster_dict = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade in self.roster_dict:
            self.roster_dict[grade].append(name)
        else:
            self.roster_dict[grade] = [name]

    def roster(self):
        roster_list = []
        for grade in sorted(self.roster_dict.keys()):
            roster_list.extend(sorted(self.roster_dict[grade]))
        return roster_list

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.roster_dict:
            return sorted(self.roster_dict[grade_number])
        else:
            return []

    def added(self):
        return self.roster()
```

I have added a dictionary `roster_dict` to store the students' names for each grade. The `add_student` method checks if the grade already exists in the dictionary and appends the student's name to the list of names for that grade. If the grade doesn't exist, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary.

The `roster` method returns a sorted list of all students in all grades. It iterates over the keys of the `roster_dict` in sorted order and appends the sorted list of names for each grade to the final roster list.

The `grade` method returns a sorted list of students for a given grade. If the grade exists in the `roster_dict`, it returns the sorted list of names for that grade. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.

The `added` method is just a helper method that calls the `roster` method to get the updated roster after adding a student.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Apologies for the confusion. Based on the test failures, it seems that the `added()` method in the `School` class is not returning the expected results. The `added()` method should return the roster of all students in the school, sorted by grade and then by name.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `added()` method to return the correct roster. Here's the updated code for the `School` class:

grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roster_dict = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade in self.roster_dict:
            self.roster_dict[grade].append(name)
        else:
            self.roster_dict[grade] = [name]

    def roster(self):
        roster_list = []
        for grade in sorted(self.roster_dict.keys()):
            roster_list.extend(sorted(self.roster_dict[grade]))
        return roster_list

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.roster_dict:
            return sorted(self.roster_dict[grade_number])
        else:
            return []

    def added(self):
        roster_list = []
        for grade in sorted(self.roster_dict.keys()):
            roster_list.extend(self.roster_dict[grade])
        return sorted(roster_list)
```

Please replace the content of the `grade_school.py` file with the updated code above. This should resolve the test failures.
