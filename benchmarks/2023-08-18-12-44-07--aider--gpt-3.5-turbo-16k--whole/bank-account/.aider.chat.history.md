#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
#### Watch out for concurrent transactions!  
####   
#### A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways.  
#### Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc.  
#### Shops can charge against the account.  
####   
#### Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language).  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:    
####   
####   
#### ```python  
#### # account is not open  
#### raise ValueError('account not open')  
####   
#### # account is already open  
#### raise ValueError('account already open')  
####   
#### # incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')  
####   
#### # withdrawal is too big  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `bank_account.py` is a class `BankAccount` with empty method stubs. To implement the required functionality, we need to make the following changes:

1. Add instance variables to keep track of the account balance and whether the account is open or closed.
2. Implement the `open` method to open the account.
3. Implement the `close` method to close the account.
4. Implement the `get_balance` method to return the current balance.
5. Implement the `deposit` method to add the specified amount to the balance.
6. Implement the `withdraw` method to subtract the specified amount from the balance.

Here is the updated code for `bank_account.py`:

bank_account.py
```
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0
        self.is_open = False

    def open(self):
        if self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.is_open = True

    def close(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.is_open = False

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
        self.balance -= amount
```

Based on the error message, it seems that when an account is reopened, the balance is not being reset to 0. To fix this, we need to add a line of code in the `open` method to reset the balance to 0 when the account is opened.

Here is the updated code for `bank_account.py`:

bank_account.py
```
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0
        self.is_open = False

    def open(self):
        if self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.is_open = True
        self.balance = 0  # Reset balance to 0 when account is opened

    def close(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.is_open = False

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self.is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
        self.balance -= amount
```

Please replace the content of `bank_account.py` with the updated code above.
