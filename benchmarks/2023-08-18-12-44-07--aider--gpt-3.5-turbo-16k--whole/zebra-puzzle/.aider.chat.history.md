Based on the instructions provided, it seems like we need to implement the zebra puzzle logic in the `zebra_puzzle.py` file. The existing function stubs `drinks_water()` and `owns_zebra()` can be used to solve the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle, we can use a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error. We'll need to define variables to represent the different attributes of the houses and their inhabitants, such as color, nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette brand. We can then use these variables to define constraints and solve the puzzle.

Here's an updated version of the `zebra_puzzle.py` file with the puzzle logic implemented:

    return None
```

This updated code defines the variables for the different attributes and constraints of the puzzle. It also includes helper functions to check if two houses are adjacent or if one house is to the right of another. The `satisfies_constraints()` function checks if a given combination of attributes satisfies all the constraints.

The `drinks_water()` function uses the puzzle logic to find the resident who drinks water. It generates all possible combinations of attributes and checks each combination to find the one that satisfies all constraints. It returns the drink of the resident who drinks water.

The `owns_zebra()` function uses the same puzzle logic to find the resident who owns the zebra. It generates all possible combinations of attributes and checks each combination to find the one that satisfies all constraints. It returns the pet of the resident who owns the zebra.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

The errors indicate that there is an issue with the constraints defined in the `drinks_water` and `owns_zebra` functions. It seems that the constraints are missing the third element, which specifies the relationship between the two attributes.

To fix the issue, you need to update the constraints in both functions to include the third element for each constraint. Here's the updated code:
