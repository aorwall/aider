#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.  
####   
#### The Romans were a clever bunch.  
#### They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  
#### They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.  
#### One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.  
#### This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
#### For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.  
####   
#### The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
#### (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  => I  
#### 10  => X  
####  7  => VII  
#### ```  
####   
#### The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.  
#### (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)  
####   
#### Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.  
####   
#### To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.  
####   
#### In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:  
####   
#### 1000=M  
#### 900=CM  
#### 90=XC  
####   
#### 2008 is written as MMVIII:  
####   
#### 2000=MM  
#### 8=VIII  
####   
#### Learn more about [Roman numerals on Wikipedia][roman-numerals].  
####   
#### [roman-numerals]: https://wiki.imperivm-romanvm.com/wiki/Roman_Numerals  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `roman_numerals.py` is just a function stub for the `roman` function. We need to implement the logic to convert normal numbers to Roman numerals. Here's the updated code:

roman_numerals.py
```
def roman(number):
    roman_numerals = {
        1000: 'M',
        900: 'CM',
        500: 'D',
        400: 'CD',
        100: 'C',
        90: 'XC',
        50: 'L',
        40: 'XL',
        10: 'X',
        9: 'IX',
        5: 'V',
        4: 'IV',
        1: 'I'
    }

    result = ''
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():
        while number >= value:
            result += numeral
            number -= value

    return result
```

This code uses a dictionary `roman_numerals` to map the decimal values to their corresponding Roman numeral representation. It then iterates through the dictionary in descending order of values and checks if the given number is greater than or equal to the current value. If it is, it appends the corresponding numeral to the result string and subtracts the value from the number. This process continues until the number becomes zero.

Now the `roman` function will correctly convert normal numbers to Roman numerals.
