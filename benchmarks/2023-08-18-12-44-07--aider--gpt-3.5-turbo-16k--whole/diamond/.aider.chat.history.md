#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.  
#### Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### - The first row contains one 'A'.  
#### - The last row contains one 'A'.  
#### - All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.  
#### - All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).  
#### - The diamond is horizontally symmetric.  
#### - The diamond is vertically symmetric.  
#### - The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).  
#### - The letters form a diamond shape.  
#### - The top half has the letters in ascending order.  
#### - The bottom half has the letters in descending order.  
#### - The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'A':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### A  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'C':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ··A··  
#### ·B·B·  
#### C···C  
#### ·B·B·  
#### ··A··  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'E':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ····A····  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### E·······E  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ····A····  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `diamond.py` is just a function stub for the `rows` function. We need to implement the logic to generate the diamond shape based on the given letter.

Here's the updated code for `diamond.py`:

diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows in the diamond
    num_rows = (ord(letter) - ord('A')) * 2 + 1

    # Create an empty diamond grid
    diamond = [[' ' for _ in range(num_rows)] for _ in range(num_rows)]

    # Fill the diamond grid with the letters
    current_letter = 'A'
    middle_row = num_rows // 2
    for i in range(middle_row + 1):
        row = diamond[i]
        row[middle_row - i] = current_letter
        row[middle_row + i] = current_letter
        current_letter = chr(ord(current_letter) + 1)

    # Fill the bottom half of the diamond grid
    for i in range(middle_row + 1, num_rows):
        diamond[i] = diamond[num_rows - i - 1]

    # Convert the diamond grid to a list of strings
    diamond_rows = [''.join(row) for row in diamond]

    return diamond_rows
```

This code calculates the number of rows in the diamond based on the given letter. It then creates an empty diamond grid and fills it with the letters in the appropriate positions. Finally, it converts the diamond grid to a list of strings and returns it.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
