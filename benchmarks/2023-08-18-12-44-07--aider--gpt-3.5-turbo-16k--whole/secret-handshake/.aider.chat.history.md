#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You are starting a secret coding club with some friends and friends-of-friends.  
#### Not everyone knows each other, so you and your friends have decided to create a secret handshake that you can use to recognize that someone is a member.  
#### You don't want anyone who isn't in the know to be able to crack the code.  
####   
#### You've designed the code so that one person says a number between 1 and 31, and the other person turns it into a series of actions.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to convert a number between 1 and 31 to a sequence of actions in the secret handshake.  
####   
#### The sequence of actions is chosen by looking at the rightmost five digits of the number once it's been converted to binary.  
#### Start at the right-most digit and move left.  
####   
#### The actions for each number place are:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### 00001 = wink  
#### 00010 = double blink  
#### 00100 = close your eyes  
#### 01000 = jump  
#### 10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Let's use the number `9` as an example:  
####   
#### - 9 in binary is `1001`.  
#### - The digit that is farthest to the right is 1, so the first action is `wink`.  
#### - Going left, the next digit is 0, so there is no double-blink.  
#### - Going left again, the next digit is 0, so you leave your eyes open.  
#### - Going left again, the next digit is 1, so you jump.  
####   
#### That was the last digit, so the final code is:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### wink, jump  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given the number 26, which is `11010` in binary, we get the following actions:  
####   
#### - double blink  
#### - jump  
#### - reverse actions  
####   
#### The secret handshake for 26 is therefore:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
#### jump, double blink  
#### ```  
####

#### ~~~~  
#### To keep things simple (and to let you focus on the important part of this exercise), your function will receive its inputs as binary strings:  
####   
#### ```  
#### >>> commands("00011")  
#### ["wink", "double blink"]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: secret_handshake.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `secret_handshake.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. We need to implement the `commands` function according to the given instructions.

Here's the updated code for `secret_handshake.py`:

secret_handshake.py
```
def commands(binary_str):
    actions = []
    binary_str = binary_str[::-1]  # Reverse the binary string
    if len(binary_str) >= 1 and binary_str[0] == '1':
        actions.append("wink")
    if len(binary_str) >= 2 and binary_str[1] == '1':
        actions.append("double blink")
    if len(binary_str) >= 3 and binary_str[2] == '1':
        actions.append("close your eyes")
    if len(binary_str) >= 4 and binary_str[3] == '1':
        actions.append("jump")
    if len(binary_str) >= 5 and binary_str[4] == '1':
        actions.reverse()
    return actions
```

In the updated code, we first reverse the binary string to start from the rightmost digit. Then, we check each digit of the binary string and add the corresponding action to the `actions` list. If the fifth digit is 1, we reverse the order of the actions.

Now, the `commands` function will return a list of actions based on the given binary string.

Let me know if you need anything else.
