#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.  
#### They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.  
#### To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.  
#### You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".  
####   
#### The best known English pangram is:

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.  
####   
#### A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.  
#### It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).  
####   
#### For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. To check if a sentence is a pangram, we need to count the occurrence of each letter in the sentence and ensure that all 26 letters are present.

Here's the updated code for the `is_pangram` function:

pangram.py
```
def is_pangram(sentence):
    # Convert the sentence to lowercase
    sentence = sentence.lower()

    # Create a set to store the unique letters in the sentence
    letters = set()

    # Iterate over each character in the sentence
    for char in sentence:
        # Check if the character is a letter
        if char.isalpha():
            # Add the letter to the set
            letters.add(char)

    # Check if all 26 letters are present in the set
    return len(letters) == 26
```

This code converts the sentence to lowercase to make it case-insensitive. It then iterates over each character in the sentence and adds the letters to a set. Finally, it checks if the set contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
