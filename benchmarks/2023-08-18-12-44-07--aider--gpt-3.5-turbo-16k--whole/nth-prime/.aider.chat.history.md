#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.  
####   
#### By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.  
####   
#### If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `prime()` function receives malformed input. Since this exercise deals only with _positive_ numbers, any number < 1 is malformed.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the prime function receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nth_prime.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `nth_prime.py` is just a function stub for the `prime()` function. We need to implement the logic to find the nth prime number. Here's the updated code:

nth_prime.py
```
def prime(n):
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')

    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        is_prime = True
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1

    return primes[-1]
```

In the updated code, we first check if the input `n` is less than 1. If it is, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

Then, we initialize an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers. We start with `num` as 2 and keep incrementing it until we have found `n` prime numbers.

Inside the while loop, we check if `num` is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the `primes` list. If it is, we set `is_prime` to False and break out of the loop. Otherwise, we append `num` to the `primes` list.

Finally, we return the last element of the `primes` list, which is the nth prime number.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
