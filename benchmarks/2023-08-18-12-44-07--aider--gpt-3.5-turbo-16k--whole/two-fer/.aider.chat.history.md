#### # Introduction  
####   
#### In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".  
#### Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.  
#### So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.  
####   
#### Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").  
#### You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.  
####   
#### If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### One for Do-yun, one for me.  
#### ```  
####   
#### If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.  
#### Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### One for you, one for me.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Here are some examples:  
####   
#### | Name   | Dialogue                    |  
#### | :----- | :-------------------------- |  
#### | Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |  
#### | Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |  
#### |        | One for you, one for me.    |  
#### | Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |  
####   
#### ####  
####

The current code in `two_fer.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. We need to modify the code to implement the logic based on the instructions provided.

Here's the updated code for `two_fer.py`:

two_fer.py
```
def two_fer(name):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```

In the updated code, we check if the `name` parameter is provided. If it is, we return the string "One for {name}, one for me." where `{name}` is replaced with the actual name. If the `name` parameter is not provided, we return the string "One for you, one for me."

This implementation covers the scenarios mentioned in the instructions.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Based on the error message, it seems that the `two_fer()` function is missing a required positional argument `name`. To fix this error, we can provide a default value for the `name` parameter in the function signature.

Here is the updated code for `two_fer.py`:

two_fer.py
```
def two_fer(name="you"):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```

In this updated code, the `name` parameter has a default value of "you". This means that if no `name` argument is provided when calling the `two_fer()` function, it will default to "you".

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
