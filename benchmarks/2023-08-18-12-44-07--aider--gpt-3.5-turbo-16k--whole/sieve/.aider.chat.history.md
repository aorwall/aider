#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You bought a big box of random computer parts at a garage sale.  
#### You've started putting the parts together to build custom computers.  
####   
#### You want to test the performance of different combinations of parts, and decide to create your own benchmarking program to see how your computers compare.  
#### You choose the famous "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm, an ancient algorithm, but one that should push your computers to the limits.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to create a program that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers.  
####   
#### A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.  
#### For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.  
####   
#### The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm that works by taking a list of numbers and crossing out all the numbers that aren't prime.  
####   
#### A number that is **not** prime is called a "composite number".  
####   
#### To use the Sieve of Eratosthenes, you first create a list of all the numbers between 2 and your given number.  
#### Then you repeat the following steps:  
####   
#### 1. Find the next unmarked number in your list. This is a prime number.  
#### 2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as composite (not prime).  
####   
#### You keep repeating these steps until you've gone through every number in your list.  
#### At the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### [Wikipedia's Sieve of Eratosthenes article][eratosthenes] has a useful graphic that explains the algorithm.  
####   
#### The tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct list of primes.  
#### A good first test is to check that you do not use division or remainder operations.

#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current content of the `sieve.py` file is as follows:

sieve.py
```
def primes(limit):
    pass
```

To implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, we need to make changes to the `primes` function. We will replace the `pass` statement with the actual implementation of the algorithm.

Here's the updated content of the `sieve.py` file:

sieve.py
```
def primes(limit):
    # Create a list of numbers from 2 to the given limit
    numbers = [True] * (limit + 1)
    numbers[0] = numbers[1] = False

    # Apply the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
    for i in range(2, int(limit ** 0.5) + 1):
        if numbers[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, limit + 1, i):
                numbers[j] = False

    # Collect the prime numbers
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, limit + 1):
        if numbers[i]:
            primes.append(i)

    return primes
```

This implementation creates a list of numbers from 2 to the given limit and initializes them as `True`. It then applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm by iterating over the numbers and marking the multiples of each prime number as `False`. Finally, it collects the prime numbers and returns them as a list.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
