#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the `keep` and `discard` operation on collections.  
#### Given a collection and a predicate on the collection's elements, `keep` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is true, while `discard` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is false.  
####   
#### For example, given the collection of numbers:  
####   
#### - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
####   
#### And the predicate:  
####   
#### - is the number even?  
####   
#### Then your keep operation should produce:  
####   
#### - 2, 4  
####   
#### While your discard operation should produce:  
####   
#### - 1, 3, 5  
####   
#### Note that the union of keep and discard is all the elements.  
####   
#### The functions may be called `keep` and `discard`, or they may need different names in order to not clash with existing functions or concepts in your language.  
####   
#### ## Restrictions  
####   
#### Keep your hands off that filter/reject/whatchamacallit functionality provided by your standard library!  
#### Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: strain.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `strain.py` does not contain any implementation for the `keep` and `discard` functions. We need to add the implementation for these functions based on the given instructions.

Here's the updated code for `strain.py`:

strain.py
```
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if predicate(item)]


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if not predicate(item)]
```

In the updated code, we are using list comprehension to filter the elements of the `sequence` based on the `predicate`. The `keep` function returns a new list containing the elements for which the `predicate` is true, while the `discard` function returns a new list containing the elements for which the `predicate` is false.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
