#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a² + b² = c²  
#### ```  
####   
#### and such that,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a < b < c  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 3² + 4² = 5².  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.  
####   
#### For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### *NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pythagorean_triplet.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. To solve the problem, we need to generate all possible Pythagorean triplets for a given sum. Here's the updated code:

pythagorean_triplet.py
```
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    triplets = []
    for a in range(1, number):
        for b in range(a + 1, number):
            c = number - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                triplets.append([a, b, c])
    return triplets
```

In this updated code, we iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the range of 1 to `number`. We calculate `c` as the difference between `number` and `a` and `b`. If the condition `a**2 + b**2 == c**2` is satisfied, we add the triplet `[a, b, c]` to the `triplets` list. Finally, we return the list of triplets.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
