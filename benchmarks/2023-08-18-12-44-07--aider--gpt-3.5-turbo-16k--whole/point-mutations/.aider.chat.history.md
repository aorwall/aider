#### Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.  
####   
#### A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or  
#### copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are  
#### vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect  
#### throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very  
#### rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,  
#### the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated  
#### result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.  
####   
#### The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point  
#### mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.  
####   
#### By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands  
#### taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of  
#### the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the  
#### evolutionary path between the two strands.  
####   
#### This is called the 'Hamming distance'

####   
#### The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.  
####   
#### ## Implementation notes  
####   
#### The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you  
#### may assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming  
#### distance function.  
####   
#### **Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**

The current code in `point_mutations.py` is just a function stub for `hamming_distance`. We need to implement the function to calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.

Here's the updated code for `point_mutations.py`:

point_mutations.py
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("DNA strands must have equal length")
    
    distance = 0
    for base1, base2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
        if base1 != base2:
            distance += 1
    
    return distance
```

In the updated code, we first check if the lengths of the two DNA strands are equal. If not, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that the DNA strands must have equal length.

Then, we initialize a variable `distance` to keep track of the number of differences between the two strands. We iterate over the corresponding bases of the two strands using the `zip` function. If the bases are different, we increment the `distance` by 1.

Finally, we return the calculated `distance`.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

The issue in the code is that it raises a `ValueError` when the DNA strands have different lengths. However, the test cases expect the function to ignore the extra length on either strand when they are longer.

To fix this, we can modify the code to calculate the Hamming distance only up to the length of the shorter strand. This way, any extra length on either strand will be ignored.

Here is the updated code for `point_mutations.py`:

point_mutations.py
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    distance = 0
    for base1, base2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
        if base1 != base2:
            distance += 1
    
    return distance
```

Please note that the check for equal length has been removed, as it is not necessary anymore.
