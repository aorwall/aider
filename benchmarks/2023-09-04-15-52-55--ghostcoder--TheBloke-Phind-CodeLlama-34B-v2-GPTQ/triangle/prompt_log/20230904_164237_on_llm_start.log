### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```

```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: triangle.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    pass


def isosceles(sides):
    pass


def scalene(sides):
    pass

```
