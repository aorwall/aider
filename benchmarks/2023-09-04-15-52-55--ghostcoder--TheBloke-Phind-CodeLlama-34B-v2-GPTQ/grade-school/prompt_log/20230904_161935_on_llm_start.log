Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think.
    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.
    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grade_school.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: grade_school.py
```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self._students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if not name in self._students:
            self._students[name] = grade

            return f"OK."
        else:
            return f"{name} is already in the roster."

    def roster(self):
        roster = []
        for name, grade in self._students.items():
            roster.append((grade, name))

        roster.sort()
        return ', '.join([name for _, name in roster])

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        grade = []
        for name, g in self._students.items():
