### User Message
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### User Message
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: isogram.py
```python

```


### Assistant
Filepath: isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '').replace('-', '')
    return len(string) == len(set(string))

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in isogram.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '').replace('-', '')
    return len(string) == len(set(string))

```
