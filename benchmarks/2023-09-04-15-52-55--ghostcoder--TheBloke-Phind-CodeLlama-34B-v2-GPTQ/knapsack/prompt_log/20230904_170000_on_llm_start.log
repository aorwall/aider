# Instructions

In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.

Bob is a thief.
After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.

In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).
Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.
However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).

Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.
Note that Bob can take only one of each item.

All values given will be strictly positive.
Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.

For example:

Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]

Knapsack Limit: 10

For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.

In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.
He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in knapsack.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: knapsack.py
```python
import itertools
from typing import List, Tuple

Item = Tuple[int, int]

def maximum_value(maximum_weight: int, items: List[Item]) -> int:
    # Sort the items by their ratio of value to weight in descending order

    # Initialize the maximum value to 0
    max_val = 0

    # Iterate over different combinations of items
    for i in range(len(sorted_items)+1):
        for combo in itertools.combinations(sorted_items, i):
            # Calculate the current weight and value
            curr_weight = sum([item[0] for item in combo])
