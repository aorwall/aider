# Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_name.py
```python

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_name.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
import random
import string

class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = None

    def get_name(self):
        if not self._name:
            self._generate_new_name()
        return self._name

    def _generate_new_name(self):
        letters = string.ascii_uppercase
        numbers = string.digits
        self._name = ''.join([random.choice(letters) for _ in range(2)] + [random.choice(numbers) for _ in range(3)])

    def reset_factory_settings(self):
        self._name = None
