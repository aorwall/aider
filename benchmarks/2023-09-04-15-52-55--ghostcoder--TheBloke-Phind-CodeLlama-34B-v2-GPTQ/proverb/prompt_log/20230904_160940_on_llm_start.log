### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```



### User Message
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### User Message
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.

Given a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb.
For example, given the list `["nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"]`, you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
```

Note that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content.
No line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.
# Instructions append

In [concept:python/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment](https://github.com/exercism/python/tree/main/concepts/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment), you learned multiple techniques for working with `lists`/`tuples` of arbitrary length as well as function arguments of arbitrary length.
This exercise would be a great place to practice those techniques.

## How this exercise is implemented for Python

The test cases for this track add an additional keyword argument called `qualifier`.
You should use this keyword arguments value to modify the final verse of your Proverb.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: proverb.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: proverb.py
```python
def proverb():
    pass

```
