# Instructions

Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.

> [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of clause is called embedding.
> It is through the processes of recursion and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.
> Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long structure, in theory anyway.
