You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```

```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some type, like a set.
In this exercise you will define your own set.
How it works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of unique elements.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: custom_set.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: custom_set.py
```python
class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=[]):
        pass

    def isempty(self):
        pass

    def __contains__(self, element):
        pass

    def issubset(self, other):
        pass

    def isdisjoint(self, other):
        pass

    def __eq__(self, other):
        pass

    def add(self, element):
        pass

    def intersection(self, other):
        pass

    def __sub__(self, other):
        pass

    def __add__(self, other):
        pass

```
