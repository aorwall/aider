# Instructions

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

Punctuation is handled as follows: hyphens are word separators (like whitespace); all other punctuation can be removed from the input.

For example:

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|As Soon As Possible|ASAP|
|Liquid-crystal display|LCD|
|Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: acronym.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: acronym.py
```python

```


### Assistant
Filepath: acronym.py
```python
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    words = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '', words) # Remove punctuation except space
    words = words.split() # Split into separate words
    acronym = ''.join([word[0].upper() for word in words]) # Take first letter of each word
    return acronym

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in acronym.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: acronym.py
```python
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    words = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '', words) # Remove punctuation except space
    words = words.split() # Split into separate words
    acronym = ''.join([word[0].upper() for word in words]) # Take first letter of each word
    return acronym
