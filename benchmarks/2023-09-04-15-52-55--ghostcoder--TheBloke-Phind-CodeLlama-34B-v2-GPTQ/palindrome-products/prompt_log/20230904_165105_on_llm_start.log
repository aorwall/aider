# Instructions

Detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
For example, `121` is a palindromic number but `112` is not.

Given a range of numbers, find the largest and smallest palindromes which
are products of two numbers within that range.

Your solution should return the largest and smallest palindromes, along with the factors of each within the range.
If the largest or smallest palindrome has more than one pair of factors within the range, then return all the pairs.

## Example 1

Given the range `[1, 9]` (both inclusive)...

And given the list of all possible products within this range:
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 15, 21, 24, 27, 20, 28, 32, 36, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 42, 48, 54, 49, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81]`

The palindrome products are all single digit numbers (in this case):
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

The smallest palindrome product is `1`.
Its factors are `(1, 1)`.
The largest palindrome product is `9`.
Its factors are `(1, 9)` and `(3, 3)`.

## Example 2

Given the range `[10, 99]` (both inclusive)...

The smallest palindrome product is `121`.
Its factors are `(11, 11)`.
The largest palindrome product is `9009`.
Its factors are `(91, 99)`.
# Instructions append

## Notes regarding the implementation of `smallest` and `largest`:

Both functions must take two keyword arguments:
- `max_factor`: int
- `min_factor`: int, default 0

Their return value must be a `tuple -- (value, factors)` where `value` is the
palindrome itself, and `factors` is an `iterable` containing both factors of the
palindrome in arbitrary order.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `largest()` or `smallest()` function receives a pair of factors that are not in the correct range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the max_factor is less than the min_factor
raise ValueError("min must be <= max")
```
