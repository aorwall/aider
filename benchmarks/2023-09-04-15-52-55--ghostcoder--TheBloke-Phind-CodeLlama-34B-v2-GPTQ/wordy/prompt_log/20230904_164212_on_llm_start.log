### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Iteration 0 — Numbers

Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.

> What is 5?

Evaluates to 5.

## Iteration 1 — Addition

Add two numbers together.

> What is 5 plus 13?

Evaluates to 18.

Handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Now, perform the other three operations.

> What is 7 minus 5?

2

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

24

> What is 25 divided by 5?

5

## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations

Handle a set of operations, in sequence.

Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

24

> What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?

15  (i.e. not 9)

## Iteration 4 — Errors

The parser should reject:

- Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")
- Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")
- Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")
# Instructions append

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the question contains an unknown operation.
raise ValueError("unknown operation")

# if the question is malformed or invalid.
raise ValueError("syntax error")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
