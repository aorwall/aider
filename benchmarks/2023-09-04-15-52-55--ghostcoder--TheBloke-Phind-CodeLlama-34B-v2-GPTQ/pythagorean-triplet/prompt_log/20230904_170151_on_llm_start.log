# Instructions

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.
# Instructions append

*NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pythagorean_triplet.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in pythagorean_triplet.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: pythagorean_triplet.py
```python
import math

def triplets_with_sum(N):
    results = []

    # Iterate over possible values of a
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(N))):
        # Iterate over possible values of b
        for b in range(a+1, int(math.sqrt(N - a))):
            # Calculate c using the Pythagorean theorem
            c = math.sqrt((a**2) + (b**2))

            # If c is an integer and a + b + c equals N, then we found a valid triplet
            if c.is_integer() and a + b + round(c) == N:
                results.append([int(a), int(b), int(round(c))])

    return results
