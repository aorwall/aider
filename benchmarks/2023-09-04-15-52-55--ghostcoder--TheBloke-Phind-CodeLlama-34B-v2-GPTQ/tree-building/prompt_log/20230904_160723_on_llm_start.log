### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Refactor a tree building algorithm.

Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.
However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.
Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.

Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.
The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.
The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).
All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.

An example tree:

```text
root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)
|-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)
|    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)
|    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)
+-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)
|    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)
+-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
