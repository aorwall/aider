# Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)
- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = sorted([int(x) for x in scores], reverse=True)

    def latest_score(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return self.scores[0]

    def top_three(self):
        return self.scores[:3]

```
