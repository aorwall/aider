### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language
code 
```



### User Message
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### User Message
Create a function named is_palindrome that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```


### Assistant
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```


### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and `reduce` are very common.
Implement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.

The precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general operations you will implement include:

- `append` (*given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list*);
- `concatenate` (*given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list*);
- `filter` (*given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True*);
- `length` (*given a list, return the total number of items within it*);
- `map` (*given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items*);
- `foldl` (*given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left*);
- `foldr` (*given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right*);
- `reverse` (*given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order*).

Note, the ordering in which arguments are passed to the fold functions (`foldl`, `foldr`) is significant.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: list_ops.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: list_ops.py
```python
def append(list1, list2):
    pass


def concat(lists):
    pass


def filter(function, list):
    pass


def length(list):
    pass


def map(function, list):
    pass


def foldl(function, list, initial):
    pass


def foldr(function, list, initial):
    pass


def reverse(list):
    pass

```
