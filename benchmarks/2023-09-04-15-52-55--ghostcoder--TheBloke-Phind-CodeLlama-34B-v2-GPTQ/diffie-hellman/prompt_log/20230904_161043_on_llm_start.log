### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

### User Message
Add a new method named area to the class Rectangle that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```


### Assistant
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Instructions

Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets.
They start with prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public keys, and then generate a shared secret key.

## Step 0

The test program supplies prime numbers p and g.

## Step 1

Alice picks a private key, a, greater than 1 and less than p.
Bob does the same to pick a private key b.

## Step 2

Alice calculates a public key A.

    A = gᵃ mod p

Using the same p and g, Bob similarly calculates a public key B from his private key b.

## Step 3

Alice and Bob exchange public keys.
Alice calculates secret key s.

    s = Bᵃ mod p

Bob calculates

    s = Aᵇ mod p

The calculations produce the same result!
Alice and Bob now share secret s.
# Should I use random or secrets?

Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.

The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate
true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness.
Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.

The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used,
precisely because it is pseudo-random.

For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates
cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.

Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but note that **it would be
very insecure if actually used for cryptography.**

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diffie_hellman.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: diffie_hellman.py
```python
def private_key(p):
    pass


def public_key(p, g, private):
    pass


def secret(p, public, private):
    pass
