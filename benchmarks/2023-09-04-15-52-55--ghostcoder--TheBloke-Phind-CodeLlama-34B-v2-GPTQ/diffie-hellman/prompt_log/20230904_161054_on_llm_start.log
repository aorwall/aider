# Instructions

Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets.
They start with prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public keys, and then generate a shared secret key.

## Step 0

The test program supplies prime numbers p and g.

## Step 1

Alice picks a private key, a, greater than 1 and less than p.
Bob does the same to pick a private key b.

## Step 2

Alice calculates a public key A.

    A = gᵃ mod p

Using the same p and g, Bob similarly calculates a public key B from his private key b.

## Step 3

Alice and Bob exchange public keys.
Alice calculates secret key s.

    s = Bᵃ mod p

Bob calculates

    s = Aᵇ mod p

The calculations produce the same result!
Alice and Bob now share secret s.
# Should I use random or secrets?

Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.

The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate
true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness.
Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.

The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used,
precisely because it is pseudo-random.

For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates
cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.

Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but note that **it would be
very insecure if actually used for cryptography.**
