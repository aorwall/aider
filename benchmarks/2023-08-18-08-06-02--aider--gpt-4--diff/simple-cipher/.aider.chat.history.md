#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a simple shift cipher like Caesar and a more secure substitution cipher.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.  
#### If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."  
#### â€”Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar  
####   
#### Ciphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render text less readable while still allowing easy deciphering.  
#### They are vulnerable to many forms of cryptanalysis, but Caesar was lucky that his enemies were not cryptanalysts.  
####   
#### The Caesar Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that were sent afield.  
#### Now Caesar knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well.  
#### So even being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't recognize the few words that they did know.  
####   
#### Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher.  
#### This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:  
####   
#### ![Caesar Cipher][img-caesar-cipher]  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Giving "iamapandabear" as input to the encode function returns the cipher "ldpdsdqgdehdu".  
#### Obscure enough to keep our message secret in transit.  
####   
#### When "ldpdsdqgdehdu" is put into the decode function it would return the original "iamapandabear" letting your friend read your original message.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Shift ciphers quickly cease to be useful when the opposition commander figures them out.  
#### So instead, let's try using a substitution cipher.  
#### Try amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance.  
####   
#### Here's an example:  
####   
#### Given the key "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", encoding the string "iamapandabear"  
#### would return the original "iamapandabear".  
####   
#### Given the key "ddddddddddddddddd", encoding our string "iamapandabear"  
#### would return the obscured "ldpdsdqgdehdu"  
####   
#### In the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value.  
#### So when the plaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming out.  
#### So "aaaa" is not an ideal key.  
#### But if we set the key to "dddd", we would get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### The weakest link in any cipher is the human being.  
#### Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that the key contains only lowercase letters.  
####   
#### If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 lowercase characters in length.  
####   
#### ## Extensions  
####   
#### Shift ciphers work by making the text slightly odd, but are vulnerable to frequency analysis.  
#### Substitution ciphers help that, but are still very vulnerable when the key is short or if spaces are preserved.  
#### Later on you'll see one solution to this problem in the exercise "crypto-square".  
####   
#### If you want to go farther in this field, the questions begin to be about how we can exchange keys in a secure way.  
#### Take a look at [Diffie-Hellman on Wikipedia][dh] for one of the first implementations of this scheme.

#### # Should I use random or secrets?  
####   
#### Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.  
####   
#### The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate  
#### true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness.  
#### Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.  
####   
#### The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used,  
#### precisely because it is pseudo-random.  
####   
#### For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates  
#### cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.  
####   
#### Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but note that **it would be  
#### very insecure if actually used for cryptography.**  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: simple_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Caesar Cipher and the substitution cipher, we will need to modify the `simple_cipher.py` file. 

The `Cipher` class will need to be updated to include the logic for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar Cipher and the substitution cipher. 

The `__init__` method will be updated to accept a key. If no key is provided, a random key of at least 100 characters will be generated. 

The `encode` method will be updated to shift each character in the input text by the corresponding character in the key. 

The `decode` method will be updated to reverse the shift applied in the `encode` method.

Here are the changes:

```python
simple_cipher.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Cipher:
    def __init__(self, key=None):
        pass

    def encode(self, text):
        pass

    def decode(self, text):
        pass
=======
import random
import string

class Cipher:
    def __init__(self, key=None):
        if key is None:
            self.key = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(100))
        else:
            self.key = key

    def encode(self, text):
        encoded_text = ''
        for i in range(len(text)):
            shift = ord(self.key[i % len(self.key)]) - ord('a')
            encoded_char = chr((ord(text[i]) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
            encoded_text += encoded_char
        return encoded_text

    def decode(self, text):
        decoded_text = ''
        for i in range(len(text)):
            shift = ord(self.key[i % len(self.key)]) - ord('a')
            decoded_char = chr((ord(text[i]) - ord('a') - shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
            decoded_text += decoded_char
        return decoded_text
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses the `random` and `string` modules to generate a random key if none is provided. The `encode` and `decode` methods use the ASCII values of the characters to perform the shift. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet. The `% len(self.key)` operation ensures that the key is used in a cyclical manner if it is shorter than the text.
