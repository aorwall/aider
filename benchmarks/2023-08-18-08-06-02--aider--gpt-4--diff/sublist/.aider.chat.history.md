#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `sublist.py` file. 

We will assign unique integer values to the constants `SUBLIST`, `SUPERLIST`, `EQUAL`, and `UNEQUAL`. 

Then, we will implement the `sublist` function. This function will compare two lists and return one of the four constants depending on the relationship between the lists. 

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. If the two lists are equal, return `EQUAL`.
2. If list_one is a sublist of list_two, return `SUBLIST`.
3. If list_one is a superlist of list_two, return `SUPERLIST`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, return `UNEQUAL`.

We will use Python's built-in `==` operator to check for equality. To check if a list is a sublist or superlist of another, we will use Python's `in` operator in combination with a list comprehension.

Here are the changes:

```python
sublist.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
SUBLIST = None
SUPERLIST = None
EQUAL = None
UNEQUAL = None

def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    pass
=======
SUBLIST = 1
SUPERLIST = 2
EQUAL = 3
UNEQUAL = 4

def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif any(list_one == list_two[i:i+len(list_one)] for i in range(len(list_two))):
        return SUBLIST
    elif any(list_two == list_one[i:i+len(list_two)] for i in range(len(list_one))):
        return SUPERLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code will correctly identify the relationship between any two lists.

sublist.py does not contain the *exact sequence* of HEAD lines you specified.
Try again.
DO NOT skip blank lines, comments, docstrings, etc!
The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in sublist.py with nothing missing!

sublist.py does not contain these 7 exact lines in a row:
```
SUBLIST = None
SUPERLIST = None
EQUAL = None
UNEQUAL = None

def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    pass
```

I apologize for the oversight. I see that I missed the comments and docstrings in the `HEAD` section of the edit block. Let's correct that.

Here are the changes:

```python
sublist.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because it’s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).
