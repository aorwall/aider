#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.  
####   
#### An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.  
####   
#### Examples of isograms:  
####   
#### - lumberjacks  
#### - background  
#### - downstream  
#### - six-year-old  
####   
#### The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `is_isogram` function, we need to modify the `isogram.py` file. 

The function should take a string as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the string is an isogram or not. 

We will implement this by:
1. Removing any spaces or hyphens from the string.
2. Converting the string to lowercase to ensure the function is case-insensitive.
3. Checking if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to the length of the string itself. If they are equal, it means all characters are unique and the string is an isogram.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
isogram.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def is_isogram(string):
    pass
=======
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '').replace('-', '').lower()
    return len(set(string)) == len(string)
>>>>>>> updated
```

> Applied edit to isogram.py
