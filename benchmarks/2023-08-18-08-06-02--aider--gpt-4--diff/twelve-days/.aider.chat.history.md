#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

#### ## Test-driven development  
####   
####  Be sure to check the comments at the top of the tests file.  
####  They will be helpful in understanding the expected output of your function.  
####   
#### This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.  
#### However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.  
#### For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.  
#### For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.  
#### What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve_days.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.

To solve this task, we need to modify the `recite` function in the `twelve_days.py` file. 

The function should take two parameters: `start_verse` and `end_verse`. It should return the lyrics of the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas" from the `start_verse` to the `end_verse`.

To avoid repetition, we can create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the day and the gift for that day. Then, we can use a loop to generate the lyrics for each day.

Here are the steps to implement this:

1. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the day and the gift for that day.
2. In the `recite` function, create an empty list to store the lyrics for each day.
3. Use a loop to iterate over the range from `start_verse` to `end_verse`.
4. For each iteration, generate the lyrics for the day and append it to the list.
5. After the loop, join the list into a string and return it.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
twelve_days.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    pass
=======
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    gifts = [
        ('first', 'a Partridge in a Pear Tree'),
        ('second', 'two Turtle Doves'),
        ('third', 'three French Hens'),
        ('fourth', 'four Calling Birds'),
        ('fifth', 'five Gold Rings'),
        ('sixth', 'six Geese-a-Laying'),
        ('seventh', 'seven Swans-a-Swimming'),
        ('eighth', 'eight Maids-a-Milking'),
        ('ninth', 'nine Ladies Dancing'),
        ('tenth', 'ten Lords-a-Leaping'),
        ('eleventh', 'eleven Pipers Piping'),
        ('twelfth', 'twelve Drummers Drumming')
    ]

    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        verse = f"On the {gifts[i][0]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
        verse += ', '.join(gift for day, gift in gifts[i::-1])
        verse = verse.replace('a Partridge', 'and a Partridge') if i != 0 else verse
        verse += '.'
        lyrics.append(verse)

    return '\n'.join(lyrics)

The error messages indicate that the `recite` function is returning a string, while the tests are expecting a list of strings. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `recite` function in the `twelve_days.py` file to return a list of strings instead of a single string.

Here is the change we need to make:

```python
twelve_days.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return '\n'.join(lyrics)
=======
    return lyrics
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will make the `recite` function return a list of strings, where each string is a verse of the song. This should resolve the test failures.
