#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a² + b² = c²  
#### ```  
####   
#### and such that,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### a < b < c  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example,  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 3² + 4² = 5².  
#### ```  
####   
#### Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.  
####   
#### For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### *NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pythagorean_triplet.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we will use a nested loop to generate all possible triplets that sum up to the given number. We will then check if the triplet is a Pythagorean triplet by checking if the square of the first number plus the square of the second number equals the square of the third number. If it is, we add it to our list of triplets.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the triplets.
2. Create a nested loop where the first loop variable 'a' runs from 1 to number/3, the second loop variable 'b' runs from 'a' to (number-a)/2, and 'c' is calculated as number - a - b.
3. Inside the inner loop, check if the triplet (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triplet. If it is, append it to the list of triplets.
4. After the loops finish, return the list of triplets.

Here is the code change needed:

```python
pythagorean_triplet.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    pass
=======
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    triplets = []
    for a in range(1, number // 3):
        for b in range(a, (number - a) // 2):
            c = number - a - b
            if a * a + b * b == c * c:
                triplets.append([a, b, c])
    return triplets

The tests are failing because the range of the second loop is not correct. The second loop variable 'b' should run from 'a' to number - a. This is because 'b' can be equal to number - a when 'a' is 1. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
pythagorean_triplet.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    triplets = []
    for a in range(1, number // 3):
        for b in range(a, (number - a) // 2):
            c = number - a - b
            if a * a + b * b == c * c:
                triplets.append([a, b, c])
    return triplets

            if a * a + b * b == c * c:
                triplets.append([a, b, c])
