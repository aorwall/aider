#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.  
####   
#### A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  
####   
#### Note that 1 is not a prime number.  
####   
#### ## Example  
####   
#### What are the prime factors of 60?  
####   
#### - Our first divisor is 2.  
####   2 goes into 60, leaving 30.  
#### - 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.  
####   - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.  
####     So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.  
#### - 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.  
####   - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 4.  
####   - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 5.  
#### - 5 does go cleanly into 5.  
#### - We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.  
####   
#### Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.  
####   
#### You can check this yourself:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 2 * 2 * 3 * 5  
#### = 4 * 15  
#### = 60  
#### ```  
####   
#### Success!  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: prime_factors.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the prime factors function, we will need to modify the `prime_factors.py` file. 

The function `factors(value)` will be updated to calculate the prime factors of the input value. 

The algorithm will work as follows:
1. Initialize a list to store the prime factors.
2. Start a loop from 2 (the smallest prime number) up to the input value.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current number divides the input value without leaving a remainder.
4. If it does, add the number to the list of prime factors and divide the input value by this number.
5. Repeat the process until the input value is reduced to 1.
6. Return the list of prime factors.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
prime_factors.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def factors(value):
    pass
=======
def factors(value):
    factors_list = []
    i = 2
    while i <= value:
        if value % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            value //= i
            factors_list.append(i)
    if value > 1:
        factors_list.append(value)
    return factors_list
>>>>>>> updated
```
