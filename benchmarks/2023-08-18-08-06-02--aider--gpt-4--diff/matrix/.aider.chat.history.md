#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.  
####   
#### So given a string with embedded newlines like:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 9 8 7  
#### 5 3 2  
#### 6 6 7  
#### ```  
####   
#### representing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     1  2  3  
####   |---------  
#### 1 | 9  8  7  
#### 2 | 5  3  2  
#### 3 | 6  6  7  
#### ```  
####   
#### your code should be able to spit out:  
####   
#### - A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,  
#### - A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.  
####   
#### The rows for our example matrix:  
####   
#### - 9, 8, 7  
#### - 5, 3, 2  
#### - 6, 6, 7  
####   
#### And its columns:  
####   
#### - 9, 5, 6  
#### - 8, 3, 6  
#### - 7, 2, 7

To implement the Matrix class, we need to modify the `matrix.py` file. 

The `__init__` method should split the input string into a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix. We can achieve this by splitting the input string by newline characters to get the rows, and then splitting each row by spaces to get the individual elements. We also need to convert each element to an integer.

The `row` method should return the row at the given index. Python list indices start at 0, so we need to subtract 1 from the input index.

The `column` method should return the column at the given index. This is a bit trickier, as we need to get the element at the given index from each row. We can use a list comprehension to achieve this.

Here are the changes:

```python
matrix.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        pass

    def row(self, index):
        pass

    def column(self, index):
        pass
=======
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        self.matrix = [[int(num) for num in row.split()] for row in matrix_string.split('\n')]

    def row(self, index):
        return self.matrix[index - 1]

    def column(self, index):
        return [row[index - 1] for row in self.matrix]
>>>>>>> updated
```
