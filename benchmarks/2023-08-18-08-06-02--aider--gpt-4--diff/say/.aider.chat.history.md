#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999, spell out that number in English.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### Handle the basic case of 0 through 99.  
####   
#### If the input to the program is `22`, then the output should be `'twenty-two'`.  
####   
#### Your program should complain loudly if given a number outside the blessed range.  
####   
#### Some good test cases for this program are:  
####   
#### - 0  
#### - 14  
#### - 50  
#### - 98  
#### - -1  
#### - 100  
####   
#### ### Extension  
####   
#### If you're on a Mac, shell out to Mac OS X's `say` program to talk out loud.  
#### If you're on Linux or Windows, eSpeakNG may be available with the command `espeak`.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Implement breaking a number up into chunks of thousands.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield a list like 1, 234, 567, and 890, while the far simpler `1000` should yield just 1 and 0.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Now handle inserting the appropriate scale word between those chunks.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield `'1 billion 234 million 567 thousand 890'`  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
#### It's fine to stop at "trillion".  
####   
#### ## Step 4  
####   
#### Put it all together to get nothing but plain English.  
####   
#### `12345` should give `twelve thousand three hundred forty-five`.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the number input to `say()` is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the number is negative  
#### raise ValueError("input out of range")  
####   
#### # if the number is larger than 999,999,999,999  
#### raise ValueError("input out of range")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: say.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the requested functionality, we need to modify the `say.py` file. 

The steps to implement the functionality are as follows:

1. We need to check if the input number is within the range 0 to 999,999,999,999. If it's not, we raise a ValueError with a meaningful message.
2. We need to handle the basic case of 0 through 99. We can use a dictionary to map numbers to their English equivalents.
3. We need to break the number into chunks of thousands. We can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 1000 and storing the remainder.
4. We need to insert the appropriate scale word (thousand, million, billion) between the chunks.
5. Finally, we need to combine all the chunks into a single string and return it.

Here is the proposed code change:

```python
say.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def say(number):
    pass
=======
def say(number):
    if number < 0 or number > 999999999999:
        raise ValueError("input out of range")

    units = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]
    digits = {
        0: "zero", 1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four",
        5: "five", 6: "six", 7: "seven", 8: "eight", 9: "nine",
        10: "ten", 11: "eleven", 12: "twelve", 13: "thirteen",
        14: "fourteen", 15: "fifteen", 16: "sixteen", 17: "seventeen",
        18: "eighteen", 19: "nineteen", 20: "twenty", 30: "thirty",
        40: "forty", 50: "fifty", 60: "sixty", 70: "seventy",
        80: "eighty", 90: "ninety"
    }

    def english(n):
        if n < 20:
            return digits[n]
        elif n < 100:
            return digits[n // 10 * 10] + ("" if n % 10 == 0 else "-" + digits[n % 10])
        elif n < 1000:
            return digits[n // 100] + " hundred" + ("" if n % 100 == 0 else " " + english(n % 100))

    parts = []
    for unit in units:
        if number % 1000 > 0:
            parts.append(english(number % 1000) + " " + unit)
        number //= 1000

    return " ".join(reversed(parts)).strip()
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code will handle numbers from 0 to 999,999,999,999 and convert them to their English equivalents. It will also raise a ValueError if the input number is out of range.

The error message indicates that the function `say` is returning an empty string when the input is 0, but the expected output is "zero". 

The issue is in the `say` function in the `say.py` file. The function is not handling the case when the input number is 0. 

To fix this, we need to add a condition at the beginning of the `say` function to return "zero" when the input number is 0.

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

```python
say.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def say(number):
    if number < 0 or number > 999999999999:
        raise ValueError("input out of range")

    units = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]
    digits = {
        0: "zero", 1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four",
        5: "five", 6: "six", 7: "seven", 8: "eight", 9: "nine",
        10: "ten", 11: "eleven", 12: "twelve", 13: "thirteen",
        14: "fourteen", 15: "fifteen", 16: "sixteen", 17: "seventeen",
        18: "eighteen", 19: "nineteen", 20: "twenty", 30: "thirty",
        40: "forty", 50: "fifty", 60: "sixty", 70: "seventy",
        80: "eighty", 90: "ninety"
    }
