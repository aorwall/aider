#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### - Each band acts as a digit of a number.  
####   For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
####   The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.  
####   The color bands are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### In `resistor-color duo` you decoded the first two colors.  
#### For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.  
#### The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value.  
#### The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.  
#### For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.  
####   
#### (If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10.  
#### If Math is not your thing, go with the zeros.  
#### It really is the same thing, just in plain English instead of Math lingo.)  
####   
#### This exercise is about translating the colors into a label:  
####   
#### > "... ohms"  
####   
#### So an input of `"orange", "orange", "black"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 ohms"  
####   
#### When we get to larger resistors, a [metric prefix][metric-prefix] is used to indicate a larger magnitude of ohms, such as "kiloohms".  
#### That is similar to saying "2 kilometers" instead of "2000 meters", or "2 kilograms" for "2000 grams".  
####   
#### For example, an input of `"orange", "orange", "orange"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 kiloohms"  
####   
#### [metric-prefix]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_trio.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `label` function in the `resistor_color_trio.py` file, we need to:

1. Define a dictionary to map the color names to their corresponding values.
2. Calculate the resistance value by combining the values of the first two colors and appending the number of zeros indicated by the third color.
3. Format the resistance value into a string with the appropriate unit (ohms or kiloohms) based on its magnitude.

Here is the proposed change:

```python
resistor_color_trio.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def label(colors):
    pass
=======
COLOR_CODES = {
    "black": 0,
    "brown": 1,
    "red": 2,
    "orange": 3,
    "yellow": 4,
    "green": 5,
    "blue": 6,
    "violet": 7,
    "grey": 8,
    "white": 9
}

def label(colors):
    value = (COLOR_CODES[colors[0]] * 10 + COLOR_CODES[colors[1]]) * (10 ** COLOR_CODES[colors[2]])
    if value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code will correctly calculate the resistance value and return it as a string with the appropriate unit.

The errors indicate that the `label` function in `resistor_color_trio.py` is not correctly handling the conversion of the resistor value to megaohms and gigaohms. Currently, it only converts to kiloohms if the value is greater than or equal to 1000. We need to add additional conditions to handle megaohms and gigaohms.

Here are the steps to fix the code:

1. Modify the `label` function in `resistor_color_trio.py` to handle megaohms and gigaohms. 

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
resistor_color_trio.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def label(colors):
    value = (COLOR_CODES[colors[0]] * 10 + COLOR_CODES[colors[1]]) * (10 ** COLOR_CODES[colors[2]])
    if value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
=======
def label(colors):
    value = (COLOR_CODES[colors[0]] * 10 + COLOR_CODES[colors[1]]) * (10 ** COLOR_CODES[colors[2]])
    if value >= 1000000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000000} gigaohms"
    elif value >= 1000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000} megaohms"
    elif value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will ensure that the `label` function correctly converts the resistor value to the appropriate unit (ohms, kiloohms, megaohms, or gigaohms) based on its magnitude.
