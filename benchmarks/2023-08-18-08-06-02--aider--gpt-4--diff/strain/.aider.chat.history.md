#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the `keep` and `discard` operation on collections.  
#### Given a collection and a predicate on the collection's elements, `keep` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is true, while `discard` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is false.  
####   
#### For example, given the collection of numbers:  
####   
#### - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
####   
#### And the predicate:  
####   
#### - is the number even?  
####   
#### Then your keep operation should produce:  
####   
#### - 2, 4  
####   
#### While your discard operation should produce:  
####   
#### - 1, 3, 5  
####   
#### Note that the union of keep and discard is all the elements.  
####   
#### The functions may be called `keep` and `discard`, or they may need different names in order to not clash with existing functions or concepts in your language.  
####   
#### ## Restrictions  
####   
#### Keep your hands off that filter/reject/whatchamacallit functionality provided by your standard library!  
#### Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: strain.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `keep` and `discard` functions, we will need to modify the `strain.py` file. 

The `keep` function will iterate over the `sequence` and add elements to a new list if the `predicate` function returns `True` for that element. 

The `discard` function will do the same, but it will add elements to the new list if the `predicate` function returns `False`.

Here are the changes:

```python
strain.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    pass


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    pass
=======
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if predicate(item)]


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if not predicate(item)]
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes use list comprehensions to create new lists based on the `predicate` function's return value. The `keep` function includes an item in the new list if the `predicate` function returns `True` for that item. The `discard` function includes an item in the new list if the `predicate` function returns `False` for that item.
