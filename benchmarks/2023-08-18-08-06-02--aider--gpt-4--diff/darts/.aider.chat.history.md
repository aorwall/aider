#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

To implement the `score` function, we need to calculate the distance from the point `(x, y)` to the origin `(0, 0)`. This can be done using the Pythagorean theorem. Once we have the distance, we can determine in which circle the dart landed and return the corresponding score.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Calculate the distance from the point `(x, y)` to the origin `(0, 0)`. This can be done using the Pythagorean theorem: `distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.
2. Check the distance against the radii of the circles:
   - If the distance is greater than 10, the dart landed outside the target and the score is 0.
   - If the distance is less than or equal to 10 but greater than 5, the dart landed in the outer circle and the score is 1.
   - If the distance is less than or equal to 5 but greater than 1, the dart landed in the middle circle and the score is 5.
   - If the distance is less than or equal to 1, the dart landed in the inner circle and the score is 10.

Here is the code change:

```python
darts.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def score(x, y):
    pass
=======
from math import sqrt

def score(x, y):
    distance = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    if distance > 10:
        return 0
    elif distance > 5:
        return 1
    elif distance > 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
