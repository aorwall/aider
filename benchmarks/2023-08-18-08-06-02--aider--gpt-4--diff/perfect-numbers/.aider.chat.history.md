#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on  
#### Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of **perfect**, **abundant**, or **deficient** based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The aliquot sum is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of 15 is (1 + 3 + 5) = 9  
####   
#### - **Perfect**: aliquot sum = number  
####   - 6 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6  
####   - 28 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14) = 28  
#### - **Abundant**: aliquot sum > number  
####   - 12 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) = 16  
####   - 24 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12) = 36  
#### - **Deficient**: aliquot sum < number  
####   - 8 is a deficient number because (1 + 2 + 4) = 7  
####   - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is **perfect**.  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is **abundant** or **deficient**.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the `classify()` function is passed a number that is not a _positive integer_.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if a number to be classified is less than 1.  
#### raise ValueError("Classification is only possible for positive integers.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `classify` function, we need to:

1. Check if the input number is a positive integer. If not, raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.
2. Calculate the aliquot sum of the number, which is the sum of its factors excluding the number itself.
3. Compare the aliquot sum with the number and return the classification as a string: "perfect", "abundant", or "deficient".

Here is the proposed code change:

```python
perfect_numbers.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def classify(number):
    """ A perfect number equals the sum of its positive divisors.

    :param number: int a positive integer
    :return: str the classification of the input integer
    """
    pass
=======
def classify(number):
    """ A perfect number equals the sum of its positive divisors.

    :param number: int a positive integer
    :return: str the classification of the input integer
    """
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError("Classification is only possible for positive integers.")
    
    aliquot_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, number) if number % i == 0)
    
    if aliquot_sum == number:
        return "perfect"
    elif aliquot_sum > number:
        return "abundant"
    else:
        return "deficient"
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code will classify the number according to Nicomachus' classification scheme.
