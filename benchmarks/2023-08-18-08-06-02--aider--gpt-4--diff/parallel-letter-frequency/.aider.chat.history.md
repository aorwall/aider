#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.  
####   
#### Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.  
#### A common example is counting the frequency of letters.  
#### Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement this, we will use Python's built-in `concurrent.futures` module for parallel computation. We will use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a pool of threads, each of which can process a part of the input text in parallel. 

The `calculate` function will be modified to create a thread pool and submit tasks to it for each text in the input list. Each task will be a call to a new function, `count_letters`, which will count the frequency of each letter in a single text. The results from all tasks will be combined into a single dictionary that gives the total frequency of each letter in all texts.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Import the `concurrent.futures` and `collections` modules.
2. Add a new function, `count_letters`, that takes a string and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each letter.
3. Modify the `calculate` function to create a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, submit a `count_letters` task for each text in the input list, and combine the results into a single dictionary.

Here are the edit blocks for these changes:

```python
parallel_letter_frequency.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def calculate(text_input):
    pass
=======
import concurrent.futures
import collections

def count_letters(text):
    return collections.Counter(c.lower() for c in text if c.isalpha())

def calculate(text_input):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(count_letters, text) for text in text_input]
        counts = collections.Counter()
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            counts.update(future.result())
    return dict(counts)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each letter. The `Counter` objects returned by the `count_letters` function are combined into a single `Counter` by the `calculate` function. The `calculate` function returns the counts as a dictionary.
