#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.  
####   
#### Your team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.  
#### That can cause all sorts of havoc.  
####   
#### But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.  
####   
#### This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.  
####   
#### Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).  
####   
#### Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:  
####   
#### - `G` -> `C`  
#### - `C` -> `G`  
#### - `T` -> `A`  
#### - `A` -> `U`  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### If you want to look at how the inputs and outputs are structured, take a look at the examples in the test suite.  
#### ~~~~

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rna_transcription.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence, we need to replace each nucleotide in the DNA strand with its RNA complement. We can use a dictionary to map each DNA nucleotide to its RNA complement. Then, we can iterate over the DNA strand and replace each nucleotide with its RNA complement.

Here are the steps to implement this:

1. Define a dictionary to map each DNA nucleotide to its RNA complement.
2. Iterate over the DNA strand.
3. For each nucleotide in the DNA strand, replace it with its RNA complement.

Here is the code change needed in the `rna_transcription.py` file:

```python
rna_transcription.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    pass
=======
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    dna_to_rna = {'G': 'C', 'C': 'G', 'T': 'A', 'A': 'U'}
    return ''.join([dna_to_rna[nucleotide] for nucleotide in dna_strand])
>>>>>>> updated
```
