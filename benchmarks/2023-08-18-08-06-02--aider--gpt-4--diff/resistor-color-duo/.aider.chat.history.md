#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
#### For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!  
####   
#### The band colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### From the example above:  
#### brown-green should return 15  
#### brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_duo.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `value` function in the `resistor_color_duo.py` file, we need to create a dictionary that maps the color names to their corresponding values. Then, we will use this dictionary to convert the first two colors in the input list to their corresponding numbers and concatenate these numbers to form the final result.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Create a dictionary `color_codes` where keys are color names and values are their corresponding numbers.
2. In the `value` function, get the first two colors from the input list.
3. Use the `color_codes` dictionary to convert these colors to numbers.
4. Concatenate these numbers to form the final result.
5. Return the final result as an integer.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
resistor_color_duo.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def value(colors):
    pass
=======
def value(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    return int(str(color_codes[colors[0]]) + str(color_codes[colors[1]]))
