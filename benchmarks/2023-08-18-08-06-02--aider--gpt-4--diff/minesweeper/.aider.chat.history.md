#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.  
####   
#### Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.  
####   
#### In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.  
####   
#### The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.  
#### A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.  
####   
#### If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ·*·*·  
#### ··*··  
#### ··*··  
#### ·····  
#### ```  
####   
#### And your code will transform it into this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 1*3*1  
#### 13*31  
#### ·2*2·  
#### ·111·  
#### ```

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()` function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the board receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: minesweeper.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Minesweeper board, we need to modify the `annotate` function in the `minesweeper.py` file. The function should take a list of strings as input, where each string represents a row in the Minesweeper board. The function should return a list of strings, where each string represents a row in the completed Minesweeper board.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Check if the input board is valid. If not, raise a ValueError with a meaningful message.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the completed board.
3. Iterate over each cell in the input board. If the cell is a mine, add it to the completed board as is. If the cell is not a mine, count the number of mines in the adjacent cells and add the count to the completed board. If there are no adjacent mines, add a blank space to the completed board.
4. Return the completed board.

Here is the code change:

```python
minesweeper.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def annotate(minefield):
    # Function body starts here
    pass
=======
def annotate(minefield):
    if not all(len(row) == len(minefield[0]) for row in minefield):
        raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")
    
    completed_board = []
    for i, row in enumerate(minefield):
        completed_row = ''
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '*':
                completed_row += '*'
            else:
                count = sum(minefield[i+di][j+dj] == '*' for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) if 0 <= i+di < len(minefield) and 0 <= j+dj < len(row))
                completed_row += str(count) if count > 0 else ' '
        completed_board.append(completed_row)
    
    return completed_board
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code change modifies the `annotate` function to implement the Minesweeper board according to the provided instructions. The function first checks if the input board is valid. If not, it raises a ValueError with a meaningful message. Then, it iterates over each cell in the input board. If the cell is a mine, it adds it to the completed board as is. If the cell is not a mine, it counts the number of mines in the adjacent cells and adds the count to the completed board. If there are no adjacent mines, it adds a blank space to the completed board. Finally, it returns the completed board.

The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is not raised when it should be. This suggests that the `annotate` function in `minesweeper.py` is not correctly handling invalid characters in the input.

To fix this, we need to add a check in the `annotate` function to raise a `ValueError` if any character in the input board is not a valid Minesweeper character. The valid characters are `*` for a mine and ` ` (space) for an empty cell.

Here are the steps to fix the code:

1. Modify the `annotate` function in `minesweeper.py` to add a check for invalid characters.

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

```python
minesweeper.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def annotate(minefield):
    if not all(len(row) == len(minefield[0]) for row in minefield):
        raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")
    
    completed_board = []
    for i, row in enumerate(minefield):
        completed_row = ''
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '*':
                completed_row += '*'
            else:
                count = sum(minefield[i+di][j+dj] == '*' for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) if 0 <= i+di < len(minefield) and 0 <= j+dj < len(row))
                completed_row += str(count) if count > 0 else ' '
        completed_board.append(completed_row)
    
    return completed_board
=======
def annotate(minefield):
    if not all(len(row) == len(minefield[0]) for row in minefield):
        raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")
    
    valid_chars = {'*', ' '}
    if not all(cell in valid_chars for row in minefield for cell in row):
        raise ValueError("The board contains invalid characters.")
    
    completed_board = []
    for i, row in enumerate(minefield):
        completed_row = ''
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '*':
                completed_row += '*'
            else:
                count = sum(minefield[i+di][j+dj] == '*' for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) if 0 <= i+di < len(minefield) and 0 <= j+dj < len(row))
                completed_row += str(count) if count > 0 else ' '
        completed_board.append(completed_row)
    
    return completed_board
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change should fix the error by raising a `ValueError` if the input board contains any characters other than `*` and ` ` (space).
