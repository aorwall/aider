#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You plan to build a tree house in the woods near your house so that you can watch the sun rise and set.  
####   
#### You've obtained data from a local survey company that show the height of every tree in each rectangular section of the map.  
#### You need to analyze each grid on the map to find good trees for your tree house.  
####   
#### A good tree is both:  
####   
#### - taller than every tree to the east and west, so that you have the best possible view of the sunrises and sunsets.  
#### - shorter than every tree to the north and south, to minimize the amount of tree climbing.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the potential trees where you could build your tree house.  
####   
#### The data company provides the data as grids that show the heights of the trees.  
#### The rows of the grid represent the east-west direction, and the columns represent the north-south direction.  
####   
#### An acceptable tree will be the largest in its row, while being the smallest in its column.  
####   
#### A grid might not have any good trees at all.  
#### Or it might have one, or even several.  
####   
#### Here is a grid that has exactly one candidate tree.  
####   
#### ```text  
####     1  2  3  4  
####   |-----------  
#### 1 | 9  8  7  8  
#### 2 | 5  3  2  4  <--- potential tree house at row 2, column 1, for tree with height 5  
#### 3 | 6  6  7  1  
#### ```  
####   
#### - Row 2 has values 5, 3, 2, and 4. The largest value is 5.  
#### - Column 1 has values 9, 5, and 6. The smallest value is 5.  
####   
#### So the point at `[2, 1]` (row: 2, column: 1) is a great spot for a tree house.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the `matrix` is irregular. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the matrix is irregular  
#### raise ValueError("irregular matrix")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####

To implement the `saddle_points` function, we need to modify the `saddle_points.py` file. 

The function should take a 2D list (matrix) as input and return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the row and column indices of a saddle point. 

A saddle point is defined as a point in the matrix that is the largest value in its row and the smallest value in its column. 

We also need to add a check to ensure that the input matrix is regular (i.e., all rows have the same number of columns). If the matrix is irregular, we should raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Check if the matrix is regular. If not, raise a `ValueError`.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the saddle points.
3. Iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, check if it is the largest value in its row and the smallest value in its column. If it is, add its indices to the list of saddle points.
4. Return the list of saddle points.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
saddle_points.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def saddle_points(matrix):
    pass
=======
def saddle_points(matrix):
    if any(len(row) != len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("irregular matrix")

    saddle_points = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
                saddle_points.append((i, j))

    return saddle_points
>>>>>>> updated
```

The error messages indicate that the test cases are expecting the saddle points to be returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has keys "row" and "column" mapping to the respective indices. However, the current implementation of the `saddle_points` function returns the saddle points as a list of tuples.

To fix this, we need to modify the `saddle_points` function in the `saddle_points.py` file to return the saddle points as dictionaries instead of tuples.

Here is the change that needs to be made:

```python
saddle_points.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
        saddle_points.append((i, j))
=======
    if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
        saddle_points.append({"row": i, "column": j})
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will ensure that the `saddle_points` function returns the saddle points in the format expected by the test cases.
