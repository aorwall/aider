#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An [Armstrong number][armstrong-number] is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`  
#### - 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`  
#### - 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`  
#### - 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`  
####   
#### Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: armstrong_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Armstrong number check, we need to modify the `is_armstrong_number` function in the `armstrong_numbers.py` file. 

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Convert the number to a string to easily get the number of digits and iterate over each digit.
2. For each digit, convert it back to an integer, raise it to the power of the number of digits, and add it to a running total.
3. After all digits have been processed, compare the total to the original number. If they are equal, the number is an Armstrong number.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
armstrong_numbers.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    pass
=======
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    # Convert the number to a string
    str_num = str(number)
    num_digits = len(str_num)

    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits
    total = sum(int(digit) ** num_digits for digit in str_num)

    # Check if the total is equal to the original number
    return total == number
>>>>>>> updated
```
