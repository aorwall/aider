#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.  
####   
#### By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.  
####   
#### If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `prime()` function receives malformed input. Since this exercise deals only with _positive_ numbers, any number < 1 is malformed.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the prime function receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nth_prime.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `prime()` function, we need to modify the `nth_prime.py` file. 

The function will take a number as an argument and return the nth prime number. If the input number is less than 1, we will raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Check if the input number is less than 1. If it is, raise a `ValueError` with the message 'there is no zeroth prime'.
2. Initialize a list to store the prime numbers we find.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current number we are checking.
4. Start a while loop that continues until we have found the nth prime number.
5. In each iteration of the loop, check if the current number is prime.
6. If it is, add it to our list of prime numbers.
7. Whether it is prime or not, increment the current number by 1.
8. Once we have found the nth prime number, return it.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
nth_prime.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def prime(number):
    pass
=======
def prime(number):
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')

    primes = []
    current = 2

    while len(primes) < number:
        if all(current % prime != 0 for prime in primes):
            primes.append(current)
        current += 1

    return primes[-1]
