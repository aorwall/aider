#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.  
####   
#### While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.  
####   
#### This is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.  
####   
#### This is one of many common variants.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a spider.  
#### It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a bird.  
#### How absurd to swallow a bird!  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cat.  
#### Imagine that, to swallow a cat!  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a dog.  
#### What a hog, to swallow a dog!  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a goat.  
#### Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cow.  
#### I don't know how she swallowed a cow!  
#### She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.  
#### She's dead, of course!

To solve this problem, we need to generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly' in a cumulative manner. We will use a list of tuples where each tuple represents a verse of the song. Each tuple will contain the animal, the comment about swallowing the animal, and the action that the old lady did to catch the previous animal.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Define a list of tuples where each tuple represents a verse of the song.
2. Implement the `recite` function to generate the lyrics of the song from the `start_verse` to the `end_verse`.

Let's start by defining the list of tuples:

```python
food_chain.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    pass
=======
verses = [
    ("fly", "", "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die."),
    ("spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.", "She swallowed the spider to catch the fly."),
    ("bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!", "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her."),
    ("cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!", "She swallowed the cat to catch the bird."),
    ("dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!", "She swallowed the dog to catch the cat."),
    ("goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!", "She swallowed the goat to catch the dog."),
    ("cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!", "She swallowed the cow to catch the goat."),
    ("horse", "She's dead, of course!", "")
]
>>>>>>> updated
```

Next, we will implement the `recite` function.

The error message indicates that the `recite` function cannot be imported from the `food_chain` module. This is because the `recite` function has not been defined in the `food_chain.py` file. 

To resolve this error, we need to add the `recite` function to the `food_chain.py` file. 

Here is the *edit block* to add the `recite` function:

```python
food_chain.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
verses = [
    ("fly", "", "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die."),
    ("spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.", "She swallowed the spider to catch the fly."),
    ("bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!", "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her."),
    ("cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!", "She swallowed the cat to catch the bird."),
    ("dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!", "She swallowed the dog to catch the cat."),
    ("goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!", "She swallowed the goat to catch the dog."),
    ("cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!", "She swallowed the cow to catch the goat."),
    ("horse", "She's dead, of course!", "")
]
=======
verses = [
    ("fly", "", "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die."),
    ("spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.", "She swallowed the spider to catch the fly."),
    ("bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!", "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her."),
    ("cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!", "She swallowed the cat to catch the bird."),
    ("dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!", "She swallowed the dog to catch the cat."),
    ("goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!", "She swallowed the goat to catch the dog."),
    ("cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!", "She swallowed the cow to catch the goat."),
    ("horse", "She's dead, of course!", "")
]

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    # Generate the lyrics of the song from start_verse to end_verse
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        animal, comment, action = verses[i]
        verse = f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animal}."
        if comment:
            verse += f" {comment}"
        if i > 0:
            verse += f" {action}"
        lyrics.append(verse)

    return lyrics
>>>>>>> updated
```

After this change, you should be able to import the `recite` function from the `food_chain` module and the tests should pass.
