#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.  
####   
#### The Romans were a clever bunch.  
#### They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  
#### They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.  
#### One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.  
#### This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
#### For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.  
####   
#### The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
#### (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  => I  
#### 10  => X  
####  7  => VII  
#### ```  
####   
#### The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.  
#### (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)  
####   
#### Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.  
####   
#### To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.  
####   
#### In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:  
####   
#### 1000=M  
#### 900=CM  
#### 90=XC  
####   
#### 2008 is written as MMVIII:  
####   
#### 2000=MM  
#### 8=VIII  
####   
#### Learn more about [Roman numerals on Wikipedia][roman-numerals].  
####   
#### [roman-numerals]: https://wiki.imperivm-romanvm.com/wiki/Roman_Numerals  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the conversion from normal numbers to Roman Numerals, we will need to modify the `roman` function in the `roman_numerals.py` file.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Create a dictionary to map the Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values. The dictionary should include the special cases like 'IV' for 4, 'IX' for 9, 'XL' for 40, 'XC' for 90, 'CD' for 400, and 'CM' for 900.
2. Start from the largest value in the dictionary and work our way down.
3. For each value, we will check how many times it can fit into the number we are converting. We will add the corresponding Roman numeral to our result that many times and subtract the total from our number.
4. Repeat this process until the number is reduced to 0.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
roman_numerals.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def roman(number):
    pass
=======
def roman(number):
    roman_numerals = {1000: 'M', 900: 'CM', 500: 'D', 400: 'CD', 100: 'C', 90: 'XC', 50: 'L', 40: 'XL', 10: 'X', 9: 'IX', 5: 'V', 4: 'IV', 1: 'I'}
    result = ''
    for value, numeral in sorted(roman_numerals.items(), reverse=True):
        while number >= value:
            result += numeral
            number -= value
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code will convert the input number to its corresponding Roman numeral.
