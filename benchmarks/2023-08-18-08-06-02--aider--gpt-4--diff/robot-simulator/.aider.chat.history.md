#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a robot simulator.  
####   
#### A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.  
####   
#### The robots have three possible movements:  
####   
#### - turn right  
#### - turn left  
#### - advance  
####   
#### Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,  
#### e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.  
####   
#### The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.  
####   
#### - The letter-string "RAALAL" means:  
####   - Turn right  
####   - Advance twice  
####   - Turn left  
####   - Advance once  
####   - Turn left yet again  
#### - Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.  
####   Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the robot simulator, we need to define the directions and movements of the robot. We will use the `Robot` class to encapsulate the robot's state and behavior.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Define the directions (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST) as tuples representing the change in x and y coordinates when moving in that direction. For example, moving north increases the y-coordinate by 1 and doesn't change the x-coordinate, so NORTH can be represented as (0, 1).

2. In the `Robot` class, initialize the robot's direction and position. The direction will be one of the direction constants, and the position will be a tuple of x and y coordinates.

3. Implement methods for turning right and left. Turning right means moving to the next direction clockwise, and turning left means moving to the next direction counterclockwise. We can implement this by keeping a list of the directions in clockwise order and rotating this list when turning.

4. Implement a method for advancing. This means changing the robot's position according to its current direction.

5. Implement a method for executing a sequence of instructions. This method will iterate over the characters in the instruction string and call the appropriate method for each instruction.

Here are the changes to make:

```python
robot_simulator.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = None
NORTH = None
WEST = None
SOUTH = None


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        pass
=======
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = (1, 0)
NORTH = (0, 1)
WEST = (-1, 0)
SOUTH = (0, -1)

DIRECTIONS = [NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST]

class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.position = (x_pos, y_pos)

    def turn_right(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index + 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def turn_left(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index - 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def advance(self):
        x, y = self.position
        dx, dy = self.direction
        self.position = (x + dx, y + dy)

    def execute_instructions(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code should implement the robot simulator as described in the instructions. The `execute_instructions` method can be used to execute a sequence of instructions and update the robot's position and direction accordingly.

The errors indicate that the test suite is expecting a `coordinates` attribute on the `Robot` object, which should return the robot's position, and a `move` method, which should execute a sequence of instructions. 

We can fix these errors by renaming the `position` attribute to `coordinates` and the `execute_instructions` method to `move`.

Here are the changes to make:

```python
robot_simulator.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.position = (x_pos, y_pos)

    # ...

    def execute_instructions(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
=======
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.coordinates = (x_pos, y_pos)

    # ...

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
>>>>>>> updated
```

This should resolve the errors and make the code compatible with the test suite.

robot_simulator.py does not contain the *exact sequence* of HEAD lines you specified.
Try again.
DO NOT skip blank lines, comments, docstrings, etc!
The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in robot_simulator.py with nothing missing!

robot_simulator.py does not contain these 15 exact lines in a row:
```
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.position = (x_pos, y_pos)

    # ...

    def execute_instructions(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
```

I apologize for the confusion. The `...` in the `HEAD` section was a placeholder and should have been replaced with the actual code. Let's correct this.

Here are the changes to make:

```python
robot_simulator.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.position = (x_pos, y_pos)

    def turn_right(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index + 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def turn_left(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index - 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def advance(self):
        x, y = self.position
        dx, dy = self.direction
        self.position = (x + dx, y + dy)

    def execute_instructions(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
=======
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.coordinates = (x_pos, y_pos)

    def turn_right(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index + 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def turn_left(self):
        index = DIRECTIONS.index(self.direction)
        self.direction = DIRECTIONS[(index - 1) % len(DIRECTIONS)]

    def advance(self):
        x, y = self.coordinates
        dx, dy = self.direction
        self.coordinates = (x + dx, y + dy)

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()

```
