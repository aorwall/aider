#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.  
####   
#### The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between `0` and `26`.  
#### Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic.  
#### The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.  
####   
#### The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.  
#### The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.  
####   
#### A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`  
#### - ROT0  `c` gives `c`  
#### - ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`  
#### - ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`  
#### - ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rotational_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Caesar cipher, we need to modify the `rotate` function in the `rotational_cipher.py` file. 

The steps to implement the function are as follows:

1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
2. Iterate over each character in the input text.
3. If the character is a letter, shift it by the key value. 
   - If the character is uppercase, ensure that it remains uppercase after the shift.
   - If the character is lowercase, ensure that it remains lowercase after the shift.
   - Use the ASCII value of the characters to perform the shift. The ASCII value of 'A' is 65, and 'a' is 97. The letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are sequentially arranged in the ASCII table. So, to shift a letter by a key, subtract the ASCII value of 'A' or 'a' from the ASCII value of the letter, add the key, take modulo 26 to handle overflow, and add back the ASCII value of 'A' or 'a'.
4. If the character is not a letter, add it to the result as it is.
5. Return the result.

Here is the code change:

```python
rotational_cipher.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def rotate(text, key):
    pass
=======
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ''
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97
            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + key) % 26 + ascii_offset)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```
