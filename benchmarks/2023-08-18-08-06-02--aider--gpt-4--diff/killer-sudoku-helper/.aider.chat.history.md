#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A friend of yours is learning how to solve Killer Sudokus (rules below) but struggling to figure out which digits can go in a cage.  
#### They ask you to help them out by writing a small program that lists all valid combinations for a given cage, and any constraints that affect the cage.  
####   
#### To make the output of your program easy to read, the combinations it returns must be sorted.  
####   
#### ## Killer Sudoku Rules  
####   
#### - [Standard Sudoku rules][sudoku-rules] apply.  
#### - The digits in a cage, usually marked by a dotted line, add up to the small number given in the corner of the cage.  
#### - A digit may only occur once in a cage.  
####   
#### For a more detailed explanation, check out [this guide][killer-guide].  
####   
#### ## Example 1: Cage with only 1 possible combination  
####   
#### In a 3-digit cage with a sum of 7, there is only one valid combination: 124.  
####   
#### - 1 + 2 + 4 = 7  
#### - Any other combination that adds up to 7, e.g. 232, would violate the rule of not repeating digits within a cage.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, with three killer cages that are marked as grouped together. The first killer cage is in the 3×3 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3×3 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3×3 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 2: Cage with several combinations  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 19  
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
#### - 46  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
####   
#### 19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]

To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible combinations of digits that add up to the target sum, with the given size and excluding the given digits. We can use a recursive approach to generate these combinations. 

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. If the size is 1, then the target itself is the only possible combination if it is between 1 and 9 and not in the exclude list. Return it as a list of single-element lists.
2. If the size is greater than 1, then for each digit from 1 to 9 that is not in the exclude list, subtract the digit from the target and recursively find combinations of size-1 that add up to the new target, excluding the current digit and the digits in the exclude list. Append the current digit to each of these combinations and add them to the list of all combinations.
3. Return the list of all combinations.

We need to modify the `combinations` function in the `killer_sudoku_helper.py` file to implement these steps.

Here is the code change:

```python
killer_sudoku_helper.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    pass
=======
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    if size == 1:
        return [[target]] if 1 <= target <= 9 and target not in exclude else []
    combinations = []
    for digit in range(1, 10):
        if digit not in exclude:
            for combination in combinations(target - digit, size - 1, exclude + [digit]):
                combinations.append([digit] + combination)
    return combinations
>>>>>>> updated
```

This function will return all valid combinations for a given cage in a Killer Sudoku puzzle, taking into account any constraints that affect the cage. The combinations are sorted because we start with the smallest digit and append combinations recursively.

The error message "TypeError: 'list' object is not callable" indicates that the function `combinations` is being treated as a list object within the function itself. This is due to the variable `combinations` being used as a list within the function, which is shadowing the function name.

To fix this, we need to rename the list variable `combinations` to something else, such as `result`.

Here is the change that needs to be made in the `killer_sudoku_helper.py` file:

```python
killer_sudoku_helper.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    if size == 1:
        return [[target]] if 1 <= target <= 9 and target not in exclude else []
    combinations = []
    for digit in range(1, 10):
        if digit not in exclude:
            for combination in combinations(target - digit, size - 1, exclude + [digit]):
                combinations.append([digit] + combination)
    return combinations
=======
def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    if size == 1:
        return [[target]] if 1 <= target <= 9 and target not in exclude else []
    result = []
    for digit in range(1, 10):
        if digit not in exclude:
            for combination in combinations(target - digit, size - 1, exclude + [digit]):
                result.append([digit] + combination)
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change should resolve the TypeError and allow the function to work as expected.
