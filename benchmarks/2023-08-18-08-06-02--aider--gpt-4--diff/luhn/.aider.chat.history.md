#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.  
####   
#### The [Luhn algorithm][luhn] is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.  
####   
#### The task is to check if a given string is valid.  
####   
#### ## Validating a Number  
####   
#### Strings of length 1 or less are not valid.  
#### Spaces are allowed in the input, but they should be stripped before checking.  
#### All other non-digit characters are disallowed.  
####   
#### ### Example 1: valid credit card number  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 4539 3195 0343 6467  
#### ```  
####   
#### The first step of the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit, starting from the right.  
#### We will be doubling  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 4_3_ 3_9_ 0_4_ 6_6_  
#### ```  
####   
#### If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9 then subtract 9 from the product.  
#### The results of our doubling:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 8569 6195 0383 3437  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then sum all of the digits:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 8+5+6+9+6+1+9+5+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the sum is evenly divisible by 10, then the number is valid.  
#### This number is valid!  
####   
#### ### Example 2: invalid credit card number  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 8273 1232 7352 0569  
#### ```  
####   
#### Double the second digits, starting from the right  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 7253 2262 5312 0539  
#### ```  
####   
#### Sum the digits  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57  
#### ```  
####   
#### 57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so this number is not valid.

To implement the Luhn algorithm, we need to modify the `Luhn` class in the `luhn.py` file. 

The `__init__` method should take a card number as a string, remove any spaces, and store it. If the card number contains any non-digit characters or is of length 1 or less, it should store None instead.

The `valid` method should implement the Luhn algorithm on the stored card number. If the card number is None, it should return False. Otherwise, it should double every second digit from the right, subtract 9 from any results that are greater than 9, sum all the digits, and return whether the sum is divisible by 10.

Here are the changes:

```python
luhn.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Luhn:
    def __init__(self, card_num):
        pass

    def valid(self):
        pass
=======
class Luhn:
    def __init__(self, card_num):
        self.card_num = ''.join(card_num.split())
        if not self.card_num.isdigit() or len(self.card_num) <= 1:
            self.card_num = None

    def valid(self):
        if self.card_num is None:
            return False
        digits = [int(d) for d in self.card_num]
        for i in range(-2, -len(digits) - 1, -2):
            digits[i] *= 2
            if digits[i] > 9:
                digits[i] -= 9
        return sum(digits) % 10 == 0
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code should work as expected according to the problem statement.
