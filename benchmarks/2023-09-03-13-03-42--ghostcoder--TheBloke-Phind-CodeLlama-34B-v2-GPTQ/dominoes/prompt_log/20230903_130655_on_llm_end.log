Here is how I would approach this problem using Python:

Firstly, we need to check whether a given list of dominos can form a valid chain. We can do this by checking if the right end dot of the nth domino matches the left end dot of the n+1 domino for every pair except for the first and last dominos. For these special cases, we also need to make sure either the first domino's left dot matches the last domino's right dot OR the first domino's right dot equals the last domino's left dot.

Now let's write down the code for `can_chain` function:

```python
def can_chain(dominoes):
    # Sort the dominos based on their key, which is the string representation of the domino
    sorted_dominnoes = sorted(dominoes, key=lambda x: str(x[0]) + "|" + str(x[1]))
    
    # Check the edge case when there's only one domino
    if len(sorted_dominnoes) == 1:
        return True

    # Iterate over the sorted dominos
    for i in range(len(sorted_dominnoes)):
        
        # If we reach the last domino, break the loop
        if i == len(sorted_dominnoes) - 1:
            break

        current_domino = sorted_dominnoes[i]
        next_domino = sorted_dominnoes[i + 1]

        # If the current domino's right value doesn't equal the next domino's left value, return False
        if current_domino[1] != next_domino[0]:
            return False
            
    # After iterating over all dominos, if no mismatch found, return True
    return True
```
This function checks whether a given list of dominos can form a valid chain or not. It sorts the dominos based on their values and then compares each domino's right value with its successor's left value. The function returns False as soon as it finds a mismatch and True otherwise.
