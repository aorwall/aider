Here is how you could implement this:

```python
def score(word):
    # Define the scoring scheme
    scores = {
        'AEILNORST': 1,
        'DG': 2,
        'BCMP': 3,
        'FHVWY': 4,
        'K': 5,
        'JX': 8,
        'QZ': 10
    }
    
    # Calculate the score
    return sum(scores[tuple(filter(lambda c: c in key, word))] for key in scores)
```
This implementation uses a dictionary to map each group of letters to its score. It then iterates over each character in the input word, checking which group it belongs to and adding the corresponding score to the total. The function finally returns the total score.
