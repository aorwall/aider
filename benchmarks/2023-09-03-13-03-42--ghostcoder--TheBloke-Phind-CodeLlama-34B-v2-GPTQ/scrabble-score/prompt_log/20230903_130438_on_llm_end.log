Here is a corrected version of `scrabble_score.py`:

```python
def score(word):
    scores = {
        ('AEIOULNRST',): 1,
        ('DG',): 2,
        ('BCMP',): 3,
        ('FHVWY',): 4,
        ('K',): 5,
        ('JX',): 8,
        ('QZ',): 10
    }

    # Calculate the score
    return sum(scores[key] for key in scores if all(c in key[0] for c in word))
```
This solution calculates the Scrabble score by iterating over each character in the input word and checking which scoring group it belongs to. It then adds up these scores at the end. The KeyError issue was due to trying to use an empty tuple as a dictionary key, this has been fixed by changing how the dictionary keys are structured and how they're accessed.
