# Instructions

Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions

- You can play a double or a triple letter.
- You can play a double or a triple word.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: scrabble_score.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is how you could implement this:
Filepath: scrabble_score.py
```
def score(word):
    # Define the scoring scheme
    scores = {
        'AEILNORST': 1,
        'DG': 2,
        'BCMP': 3,
        'FHVWY': 4,
        'K': 5,
        'JX': 8,
        'QZ': 10
    }

    # Calculate the score
    return sum(scores[tuple(filter(lambda c: c in key, word))] for key in scores)

```

This implementation uses a dictionary to map each group of letters to its score. It then iterates over each character in the input word, checking which group it belongs to and adding the corresponding score to the total. The function finally returns the total score.

    }

    # Calculate the score
    return sum(scores[tuple(filter(lambda c: c in key, word))] for key in scores)

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in scrabble_score.py to resolve the errors.
