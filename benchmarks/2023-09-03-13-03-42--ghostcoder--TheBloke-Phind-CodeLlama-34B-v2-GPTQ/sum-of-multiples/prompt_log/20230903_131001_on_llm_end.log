Here is how I would approach this problem using Python:

Firstly, let's create a helper function named "get_factors" that takes a limit and a factor as parameters and returns a set of multiples of the factor that are less than the limit. This function uses a while loop to continually increment the factor until it reaches the limit. It adds each multiple to a set, then finally returns the set.

Next, we'll modify our main function, "sum_of_multiples", to call the helper function for every factor in the provided list. Then, it sums up all the unique multiples and returns the total.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    def get_factors(factor, limit):
        factors = set()
        while factor < limit:
            factors.add(factor)
            factor += factor
        return factors
    
    total = 0
    combined_set = set()
    
    for factor in multiples:
        factors = get_factors(factor, limit)
        combined_set.update(factors)
        
    total = sum(combined_set)
    return total
```
This solution assumes that the input numbers are valid, non-negative integers and that the list of factors is also valid, containing only unique, sorted integers.
