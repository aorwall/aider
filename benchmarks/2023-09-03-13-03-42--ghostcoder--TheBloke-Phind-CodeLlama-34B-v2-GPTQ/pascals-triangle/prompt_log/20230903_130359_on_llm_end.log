Here is how I would complete the implementation of `pascals_triangle.py`:

```python
def rows(row_count):
    """
    Computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.
    :param row_count: The number of rows to compute. Must be >= 0.
    :return: A list of lists representing the rows of Pascal's triangle.
    """
    if row_count < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of rows cannot be negative.")

    result = [[1]]

    def compute_next_row(previous_row):
        next_row = []
        for index in range(len(previous_row)):
            next_value = (index == len(previous_row) - 1) \
                         and 1 \
                         or sum([previous_row[index], previous_row[index + 1]])
            next_row.append(next_value)
        return next_row

    while len(result) < row_count:
        result.append(compute_next_row(result[-1]))

    return result[:row_count]
```

This implementation uses a helper function (`compute_next_row`) to calculate each row based on the previous row. It starts with the topmost row `[1]` and then iteratively computes the next row until reaching the desired number of rows. If the input `row_count` is less than 0, it raises a `ValueError`.
