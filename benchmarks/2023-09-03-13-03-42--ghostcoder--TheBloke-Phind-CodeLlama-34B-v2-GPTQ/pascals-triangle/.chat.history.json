(i.e. 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) like so:\n\n````python\ndef factorial(number):\n  if number <= 1:  # base case\n    return 1\n\n  return number * factorial(number - 1) # recursive case\n\nprint(factorial(5)) # returns 120\n````\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Python limits the number of times recursive calls can be made (1000 by default) and does not optimize for [tail recursion][tail-recursion].\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising].\nWhen you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\nThis makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\nFor situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][built-in-errors], but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise-statement] to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `rows()` function is passed a negative number.\nThe tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the rows function is passed a negative number.\nraise ValueError(\"number of rows is negative\")\n```\n\n[built-in-errors]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes\n[raise-statement]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\n[raising]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions\n[tail-recursion]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pascals_triangle.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
