Here is how I would approach solving this problem using Python:

Firstly, let's create a dictionary for each statement that maps the information given about each resident to the house number. For example, "The Englishman lives in the red house" would map 'Englishman': 1 (since we know the Englishman lives in the first house). We do this for every statement related to the house location.

Next, we create another dictionary for statements related to the profession, pet, drink, and cigarette brand. For instance, "Coffee is drunk in the green house" would map 'coffee': 2 since coffee is drunk in the second house.

Finally, we solve the puzzle by checking which resident drinks water and who owns the zebra based on the conditions provided.

Let's apply these steps into `zebra_puzzle.py`:

```python
def drinks_water():
    # Create a dictionary for each statement related to the house location
    house_location = {'Englishman': 1, 'Spaniard': 2, 'Ukrainian': 3, 'Norwegian': 5}
    
    # Create a dictionary for statements related to the profession, pet, drink, and cigarette brand
    profession_pet_drink_cigarette = {'Chesterfields': 2, 'Fox': 2, 'Kools': 3, 'Horse': 3, 'LuckyStrike': 4, 'OrangeJuice': 4, 'Parliaments': 4, 'Japanese': 5}
    
    # Check the conditions
    for key, value in profession_pet_drink_cigarette.items():
        if value == house_location['Norwegian'] - 1:
            return key
            
def owns_zebra():
    # Create a dictionary for each statement related to the house location
    house_location = {'Englishman': 1, 'Spaniard': 2, 'Ukrainian': 3, 'Norwegian': 5}
    
    # Create a dictionary for statements related to the profession, pet, drink, and cigarette brand
    profession_pet_drink_cigarette = {'Chesterfields': 2, 'Fox': 2, 'Kools': 3, 'Horse': 3, 'LuckyStrike': 4, 'OrangeJuice': 4, 'Parliaments': 4, 'Japanese': 5}
    
    # Check the conditions
    for key, value in profession_pet_drink_cigarette.items():
        if value == house_location[key] + 1:
            return key
```

This solution assumes that there are exactly five houses and follows the clues sequentially. It does not account for any possible rearrangement or permutation of the houses.
