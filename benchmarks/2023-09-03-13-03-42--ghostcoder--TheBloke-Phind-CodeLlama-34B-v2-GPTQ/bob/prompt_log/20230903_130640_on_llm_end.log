In order to fix these issues, we need to make sure our `hey()` function actually returns something and that it correctly handles different cases. Here's an updated version of your `hey()` function:

```python
import re

def hey(message):
    message = message.strip()
    
    if re.search(r'\?\W*$', message): # Checks for a question (ends with a '?' followed by zero or more non-alphanumeric characters)
        return "Sure."
    elif re.search('[^a-zA-Z0-9]*[A-Z]{2,}[^a-zA-Z0-9]*$', message): # Checks for yelling (contains two or more capital letters in a row surrounded by zero or more non-alphanumeric characters)
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif re.search(r'\?\W*[A-Z]{2,}\W*$', message): # Checks for yelled question (question ending with yelling)
        return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
    elif message == "" or message.isspace(): # Checks for silence (empty string or string containing only white spaces)
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."

response = hey
```
This should now pass all the tests you have provided.
