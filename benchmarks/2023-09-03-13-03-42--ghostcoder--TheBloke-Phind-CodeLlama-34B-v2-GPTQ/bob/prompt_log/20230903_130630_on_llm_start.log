# Introduction

Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.
He likes to think that he's very cool.
And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.
That wouldn't be cool.

When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the modified `bob.py` file:
```python
import re

def hey(message):
    message = message.strip()
    
    if re.search(r'\?\W*$', message): # Checks for a question (ends with a '?' followed by zero or more non-alphanumeric characters)
        return "Sure."
    elif re.search('[^a-zA-Z0-9]*[A-Z]{2,}[^a-zA-Z0-9]*$', message): # Checks for yelling (contains two or more capital letters in a row surrounded by zero or more non-alphanumeric characters)
        return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif re.search(r'\?\W*[A-Z]{2,}\W*$', message): # Checks for yelled question (question ending with yelling)
        return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
    elif message == "" or message.isspace(): # Checks for silence (empty string or string containing only white spaces)
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    else:
        return "Whatever."

response = hey

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bob.py to resolve the errors.
