# Instructions

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n.
If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2.
If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.
Repeat the process indefinitely.
The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

0. 12
1. 6
2. 3
3. 10
4. 5
5. 16
6. 8
7. 4
8. 2
9. 1

Resulting in 9 steps.
So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

The Collatz Conjecture is only concerned with **strictly positive integers**, so this exercise expects you to use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) and "throw" a `ValueError` in your solution if the given value is zero or a negative integer. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when argument is zero or a negative integer
raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: collatz_conjecture.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's how I would complete the `steps` function according to the Collatz Conjecture:
Filepath: collatz_conjecture.py
```
def steps(number):
    # Check if the number is less than 1, if true then raise ValueError
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('Input must be a strictly positive integer')

    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = (3 * number) + 1
        count += 1
    return count

```

This implementation starts by checking whether the provided number is less than 1. If it is, we throw a `ValueError`, since the Collatz Conjecture deals exclusively with strictly positive integers. Then, we enter a loop that continues until our number becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, we apply the rules of the Collatz Conjecture - halving the number if it's even, multiplying it by three and adding one if it's odd - and increment a counter that keeps track of the total number of operations performed. Finally, we return the count of steps.

    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = (3 * number) + 1
        count += 1
    return count

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in collatz_conjecture.py to resolve the errors.
