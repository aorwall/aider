Here's how I would complete the `steps` function according to the Collatz Conjecture:

```python
def steps(number):
    # Check if the number is less than 1, if true then raise ValueError
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('Input must be a strictly positive integer')
    
    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = (3 * number) + 1
        count += 1
    return count
```
This implementation starts by checking whether the provided number is less than 1. If it is, we throw a `ValueError`, since the Collatz Conjecture deals exclusively with strictly positive integers. Then, we enter a loop that continues until our number becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, we apply the rules of the Collatz Conjecture - halving the number if it's even, multiplying it by three and adding one if it's odd - and increment a counter that keeps track of the total number of operations performed. Finally, we return the count of steps.
