You can fix the error by implementing the `keep` and `discard` methods as described in the instructions. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def keep(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if pred(item)]

def discard(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if not pred(item)]
```
