Here is how I would solve this problem:

```python
def keep(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if pred(item)]

def discard(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if not pred(item)]
```
In these implementations, we make use of list comprehensions to construct our output lists. The `keep()` function includes an element in the output if the predicate evaluates to True, while `discard()` includes an element only if the predicate evaluates to False.
