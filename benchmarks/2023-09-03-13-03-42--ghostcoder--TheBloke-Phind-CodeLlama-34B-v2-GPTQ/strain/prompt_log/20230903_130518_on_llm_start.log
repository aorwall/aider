### System Prompt
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:
Filepath: path/to/file
```language

# Instructions

Implement the `keep` and `discard` operation on collections.
Given a collection and a predicate on the collection's elements, `keep` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is true, while `discard` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is false.

For example, given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the predicate:

- is the number even?

Then your keep operation should produce:

- 2, 4

While your discard operation should produce:

- 1, 3, 5

Note that the union of keep and discard is all the elements.

The functions may be called `keep` and `discard`, or they may need different names in order to not clash with existing functions or concepts in your language.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that filter/reject/whatchamacallit functionality provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: strain.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is how I would solve this problem:
```python
def keep(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if pred(item)]

def discard(collection, pred):
    return [item for item in collection if not pred(item)]
```

In these implementations, we make use of list comprehensions to construct our output lists. The `keep()` function includes an element in the output if the predicate evaluates to True, while `discard()` includes an element only if the predicate evaluates to False.

def keep(sequence, predicate):
    pass


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    pass

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in strain.py to resolve the errors.
