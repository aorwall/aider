# Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think.
    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.
    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is how I would approach updating the given `grade_school.py`:

Firstly, we need some data structures to hold the information about the students and their corresponding grades. For this, we can use dictionaries where the keys represent the grades and values represent lists of student names. To ensure that each student is unique and has not been added more than once to a grade or the roster, we can use sets.

Then, we can go ahead and implement the methods according to the provided specifications. Here's my proposed implementation:
Filepath: grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self._grades = {}
        self._students = set()

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if name in self._students:
            return f"Error! {name} is already in the roster."

        if grade in self._grades:
            self._grades[grade].append(name)
        else:
            self._grades[grade] = [name]

        self._students.add(name)
        return f"OK. Added {name} to grade {grade}."

    def roster(self, grade):
        if grade not in self._grades:
            return f"No students in grade {grade} yet."

        students = ', '.join(sorted(self._grades[grade]))
        return f"Students in grade {grade}: {students}"

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number not in self._grades:
            return "No students enrolled in that grade."

        students = ', '.join(sorted(self._grades[grade_number]))
        return f"{students} in grade {grade_number}. "

    def added(self):
        total_added = len(self._students)
        return f"Total students added so far: {total_added}."

```

This implementation ensures that each method performs its intended functionality while also maintaining the conditions specified in the problem statement.
