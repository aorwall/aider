Here is how I would approach modifying the `connect.py` file based on the problem description:

Firstly, we need to understand the rules of the game. The objective of the game is to form a unbroken chain of pieces from one side of the board to the other. Each piece belongs to either Player X or Player O. If a player can make a continuous line of their pieces from one side of the board to the opposite side, then they win. However, if no player forms an uninterrupted chain from side to side, the game ends in a tie.

Now let's start by updating our `__init__()` method to initialize our game board properly. We also need to implement the `get_winner()` method which will determine the outcome of the game.

Here's my proposed implementation:

```python
import re
from collections import deque

class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.rows = board.split('\n')
        # Remove any empty rows at the end
        while len(self.rows) > 0 and len(self.rows[-1]) == 0:
            self.rows.pop()

    def get_winner(self):
        # Initialize variables to store the number of 'O' and 'X' pieces
        num_o = 0
        num_x = 0
        
        # Iterate over each row in the board
        for i in range(len(self.rows)):
            row = self.rows[i].strip().replace(' ', '')
            
            # Count the number of 'O' and 'X' pieces in the current row
            num_o += row.count('O')
            num_x += row.count('X')
            
            # Check horizontally for a win condition
            if re.search(r'(O.*O){3,}', row) is not None:
                return 'O'
            elif re.search(r'(X.*X){3,}', row) is not None:
                return 'X'
            
            # Check vertically for a win condition
            if i >= 3:
                col = ''
                for j in range(-3, 4):
                    col += self.rows[i+j][j]
                if re.search(r'(O.*O){3,}', col) is not None:
                    return 'O'
                elif re.search(r'(X.*X){3,}', col) is not None:
                    return 'X'
        
        # Since no one has won yet, check for a tie
        if num_o + num_x == len(self.rows) * len(self.rows[0]):
            return 'Tie'
        
        # If the function hasn't returned yet, then neither player has won yet
        return None
```
This script reads the game board passed into the constructor of the `ConnectGame` class. It assumes that the input is a string where each character represents a cell on the game board, using `.` for an empty cell, `O` for cells occupied by Player O, and `X` for cells occupied by Player X.

It checks horizontal and vertical lines for a win condition, counting the number of consecutive 'O' or 'X' tokens required to win. If such a line exists, the corresponding player is declared the winner. If no such line exists, the function returns `None`. If every cell on the board has been filled, and no player has won, the function declares the game a tie.
