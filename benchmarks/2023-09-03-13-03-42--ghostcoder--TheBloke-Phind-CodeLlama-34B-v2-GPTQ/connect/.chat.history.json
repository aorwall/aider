O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

The objective of the game is to form a unbroken chain of pieces from one side of the board to the other. Each piece belongs to either Player X or Player O. If a player can make a continuous line of their pieces from one side of the board to the opposite side, then they win. However, if no player forms an uninterrupted chain from side to side, the game ends in a tie.\n\nNow let's start by updating our `__init__()` method to initialize our game board properly. We also need to implement the `get_winner()` method which will determine the outcome of the game.\n\nHere's my proposed implementation:",
