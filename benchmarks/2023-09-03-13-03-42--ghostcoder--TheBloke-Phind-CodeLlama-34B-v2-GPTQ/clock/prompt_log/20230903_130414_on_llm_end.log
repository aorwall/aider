Here's what the updated clock.py file looks like after implementing __repr__ and __str__ methods:

```python
class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour, minute):
        self._hour = hour
        self._minute = minute

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self._hour}, {self._minute})"
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self._hour:02d}:{self._minute:02d}"
```

The changes are:

- Added a `__repr__` method that returns a string containing the name of the class and the values passed during instantiation. This follows the recommendation from the Python data model documentation.
- Added a `__str__` method that returns a string representing the clock time in a human-friendly format (HH:MM). It uses Python's f-strings to ensure hours and minutes always have two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.
