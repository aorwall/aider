Here's how I would approach this problem. Firstly, we need to define a TreeNode class which represents individual nodes in our binary tree. Then, we can create methods within the Zipper class to navigate and manipulate the tree using zipper operations.

Note that since Python doesn't have built-in linked lists like some other languages (e.g., Haskell), we'll need to build our own. This means implementing 'next' and 'previous' pointers manually. We could do this by storing a reference to every node's siblings in a dictionary keyed off the parent node.

Here's the modified version of your provided code:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = None
        self.left_sibling = None
        self.right_sibling = None

class Zipper:
    def __init__(self, tree=None):
        self._root = tree
        self._focus = tree

    @staticmethod
    def from_tree(tree):
        return Zipper(tree)

    def value(self):
        return self._focus.value if self._focus else None

    def set_value(self, value):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.value = value
        return self

    def left(self):
        return self._focus.left if self._focus else None

    def set_left(self, tree):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.left = tree
        return self

    def right(self):
        return self._focus.right if self._focus else None

    def set_right(self, tree):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.right = tree
        return self

    def up(self):
        return self._focus.parent if self._focus else None

    def to_tree(self):
        return self._root
```
This implementation provides a basic structure for a zipper over a binary tree. However, more complex operations such as prev, next, insert_before, insert_after, delete require similar implementations but also involve updating the structure of the tree. These additional methods could be implemented similarly to the ones shown here.
