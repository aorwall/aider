# Instructions

Creating a zipper for a binary tree.

[Zippers][zipper] are a purely functional way of navigating within a data structure and manipulating it.
They essentially contain a data structure and a pointer into that data structure (called the focus).

For example given a rose tree (where each node contains a value and a list of child nodes) a zipper might support these operations:

- `from_tree` (get a zipper out of a rose tree, the focus is on the root node)
- `to_tree` (get the rose tree out of the zipper)
- `value` (get the value of the focus node)
- `prev` (move the focus to the previous child of the same parent,
  returns a new zipper)
- `next` (move the focus to the next child of the same parent, returns a
  new zipper)
- `up` (move the focus to the parent, returns a new zipper)
- `set_value` (set the value of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_before` (insert a new subtree before the focus node, it
  becomes the `prev` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `insert_after` (insert a new subtree after the focus node, it becomes
  the `next` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)
- `delete` (removes the focus node and all subtrees, focus moves to the
  `next` node if possible otherwise to the `prev` node if possible,
  otherwise to the parent node, returns a new zipper)

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: zipper.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's how I would approach this problem. Firstly, we need to define a TreeNode class which represents individual nodes in our binary tree. Then, we can create methods within the Zipper class to navigate and manipulate the tree using zipper operations.

Note that since Python doesn't have built-in linked lists like some other languages (e.g., Haskell), we'll need to build our own. This means implementing 'next' and 'previous' pointers manually. We could do this by storing a reference to every node's siblings in a dictionary keyed off the parent node.

Here's the modified version of your provided code:
Filepath: zipper.py
```
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = None
        self.left_sibling = None
        self.right_sibling = None
class Zipper:
    def __init__(self, tree=None):
        self._root = tree
        self._focus = tree
    @staticmethod
    def from_tree(tree):
        return Zipper(tree)

    def value(self):
        return self._focus.value if self._focus else None

    def set_value(self, value):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.value = value
        return self

    def left(self):
        return self._focus.left if self._focus else None

    def set_left(self, tree):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.left = tree
        return self

    def right(self):
        return self._focus.right if self._focus else None

    def set_right(self, tree):
        if self._focus:
            self._focus.right = tree
        return self

    def up(self):
        return self._focus.parent if self._focus else None

    def to_tree(self):
        return self._root

```

This implementation provides a basic structure for a zipper over a binary tree. However, more complex operations such as prev, next, insert_before, insert_after, delete require similar implementations but also involve updating the structure of the tree. These additional methods could be implemented similarly to the ones shown here.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in zipper.py to resolve the errors.
