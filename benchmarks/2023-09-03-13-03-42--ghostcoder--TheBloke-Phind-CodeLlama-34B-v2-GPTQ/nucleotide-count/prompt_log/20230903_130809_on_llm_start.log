Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

# Instructions

Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed.
All known life depends on DNA!

> Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.

DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.
A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!
We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".

We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.
'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.

For example:

```text
"GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2
"INVALID" -> error
```

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nucleotide_count.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.


### Assistant
Here is the modified `nucleotide_count.py` file:
Filepath: nucleotide_count.py
```
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    return strand.upper().count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    counts = {'A': count(strand, 'A'),
              'C': count(strand, 'C'),
              'G': count(strand, 'G'),
              'T': count(strand, 'T')}

    # Check for invalid nucleotides
    for char in strand:
        if char not in "ACGT":
            raise ValueError("Invalid nucleotide")

    return counts

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in nucleotide_count.py to resolve the errors.
