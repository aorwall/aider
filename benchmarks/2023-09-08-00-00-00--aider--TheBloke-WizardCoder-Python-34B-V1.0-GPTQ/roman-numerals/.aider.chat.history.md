#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.  
####   
#### The Romans were a clever bunch.  
#### They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  
#### They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.  
#### One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.  
#### This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
#### For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.  
####   
#### The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
#### (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).  
####   
#### ```text  
####  1  => I  
#### 10  => X  
####  7  => VII  
#### ```  
####   
#### The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.  
#### (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)  
####   
#### Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.  
####   
#### To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.  
####   
#### In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:  
####   
#### 1000=M  
#### 900=CM  
#### 90=XC  
####   
#### 2008 is written as MMVIII:  
####   
#### 2000=MM  
#### 8=VIII  
####   
#### Learn more about [Roman numerals on Wikipedia][roman-numerals].  
####   
#### [roman-numerals]: https://wiki.imperivm-romanvm.com/wiki/Roman_Numerals  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's the updated content of the files:

roman_numerals.py
```python
def roman(number):
    """
    Convert a normal number to a Roman numeral.

    :param number: A positive integer between 1 and 3999.
    :return: The Roman numeral representation of the number.
    """
    if not isinstance(number, int) or number < 1 or number > 3999:
        raise ValueError("Number must be an integer between 1 and 3999")

    roman_numeral_mapping = {
        1000: 'M',
        900: 'CM',
        500: 'D',
        400: 'CD',
        100: 'C',
        90: 'XC',
        50: 'L',
        40: 'XL',
        10: 'X',
        9: 'IX',
        5: 'V',
        4: 'IV',
        1: 'I'
    }

    result = ''
    for value, numeral in roman_numeral_mapping.items():
        while number >= value:
            result += numeral
            number -= value

    return result
```

This updated function should now correctly convert normal numbers to Roman numerals.
