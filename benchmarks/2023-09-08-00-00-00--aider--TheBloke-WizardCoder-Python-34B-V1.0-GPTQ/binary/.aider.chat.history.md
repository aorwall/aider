#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.  
####   
#### Implement binary to decimal conversion.  
#### Given a binary input string, your program should produce a decimal output.  
#### The program should handle invalid inputs.  
####   
#### ## Note  
####   
#### - Implement the conversion yourself.  
####   Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.  
####   
#### ## About Binary (Base-2)  
####   
#### Decimal is a base-10 system.  
####   
#### A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:  
####   
#### - The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1  
#### - The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10  
#### - ...  
#### - The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.  
#### - All these values are summed.  
####   
#### So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`  
####   
#### Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.  
####   
#### So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal  
#### raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + digits)  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the updated content of the files:

binary.py
```python
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    if not all(char in '01' for char in binary_string):
        raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + binary_string)

    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(binary_string)):
        decimal += int(digit) * 2**i

    return decimal
```

This implementation checks that the input string only contains valid binary digits (0 and 1), raises a `ValueError` with a meaningful message if it doesn't, and then converts the binary string to its decimal equivalent using the standard algorithm.
