#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.  
####   
#### Your body is made up of cells that contain DNA.  
#### Those cells regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by dividing into daughter cells.  
#### In fact, the average human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!  
####   
#### When cells divide, their DNA replicates too.  
#### Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information.  
#### If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred.  
#### This is known as the "Hamming Distance".  
####   
#### We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T.  
#### Two strands might look like this:  
####   
####     GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT  
####     CATCGTAATGACGGCCT  
####     ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^  
####   
#### They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.  
####   
#### The Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not just biology, so it's a nice phrase to be familiar with :)  
####   
#### ## Implementation notes  
####   
#### The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the strands being checked are not the same length. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # When the sequences being passed are not the same length.  
#### raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####

Here is the updated content of the files:

hamming.py
```python
def distance(strand_a, strand_b):
    if len(strand_a) != len(strand_b):
        raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")
    
    hamming_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(strand_a)):
        if strand_a[i] != strand_b[i]:
            hamming_distance += 1
    
    return hamming_distance
```

This implementation checks if the two input strands are of equal length and raises a `ValueError` with a message if they are not. If they are of equal length, it calculates the Hamming distance between them and returns the result.
