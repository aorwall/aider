#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You have stumbled upon a group of mathematicians who are also singer-songwriters.  
#### They have written a song for each of their favorite numbers, and, as you can imagine, they have a lot of favorite numbers (like [0][zero] or [73][seventy-three] or [6174][kaprekars-constant]).  
####   
#### You are curious to hear the song for your favorite number, but with so many songs to wade through, finding the right song could take a while.  
#### Fortunately, they have organized their songs in a playlist sorted by the title â€” which is simply the number that the song is about.  
####   
#### You realize that you can use a binary search algorithm to quickly find a song given the title.  
####   
#### [zero]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0  
#### [seventy-three]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73_(number)  
#### [kaprekars-constant]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement a binary search algorithm.  
####   
#### A binary search algorithm finds an item in a list by repeatedly splitting it in half, only keeping the half which contains the item we're looking for.  
#### It allows us to quickly narrow down the possible locations of our item until we find it, or until we've eliminated all possible locations.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/caution  
#### Binary search only works when a list has been sorted.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### The algorithm looks like this:  
####   
#### - Find the middle element of a *sorted* list and compare it with the item we're looking for.  
#### - If the middle element is our item, then we're done!  
#### - If the middle element is greater than our item, we can eliminate that element and all the elements **after** it.  
#### - If the middle element is less than our item, we can eliminate that element and all the elements **before** it.  
#### - If every element of the list has been eliminated then the item is not in the list.  
#### - Otherwise, repeat the process on the part of the list that has not been eliminated.  
####   
#### Here's an example:  
####   
#### Let's say we're looking for the number 23 in the following sorted list: `[4, 8, 12, 16, 23, 28, 32]`.  
####   
#### - We start by comparing 23 with the middle element, 16.  
#### - Since 23 is greater than 16, we can eliminate the left half of the list, leaving us with `[23, 28, 32]`.  
#### - We then compare 23 with the new middle element, 28.  
#### - Since 23 is less than 28, we can eliminate the right half of the list: `[23]`.  
#### - We've found our item.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the given value is not found within the array. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when value is not found in the array.  
#### raise ValueError("value not in array")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's the updated binary_search.py file:

```python
def binary_search(arr, value):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the given value.

    Args:
        arr (list): A sorted list of values.

    Returns:

    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == value:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < value:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
