    return [hand for hand in hands if hand_rank(hand) == max(hand_rank(hand) for hand in hands)]
```

This implementation defines a `hand_rank` function that calculates a tuple representing the rank of a given hand. The `best_hands` function then filters the input hands to only include those with the highest rank.

The errors were caused by the incorrect indexing of the card strings. The updated code now correctly indexes the first character of the card string for the rank and the second character for the suit.
