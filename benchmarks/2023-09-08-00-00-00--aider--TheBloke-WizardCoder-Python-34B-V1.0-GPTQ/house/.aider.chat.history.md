#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.  
####   
#### > [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of clause is called embedding.  
#### > It is through the processes of recursion and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.  
#### > Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long structure, in theory anyway.
