#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.  
####   
#### The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between `0` and `26`.  
#### Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic.  
#### The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.  
####   
#### The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.  
#### The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.  
####   
#### A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`  
#### - ROT0  `c` gives `c`  
#### - ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`  
#### - ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`  
#### - ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rotational_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the updated content of the files:

rotational_cipher.py
```python
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            base = ord('A') if char.isupper() else ord('a')
            result += chr(((ord(char) - base + key) % 26) + base)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

This implementation defines a `rotate` function that takes a string `text` and an integer `key` as input. It then iterates through each character in the string, checking if it is a letter. If it is a letter, it calculates the new letter using the `key` and appends it to the `result` string. If it is not a letter, it simply appends the character to the `result` string. Finally, it returns the `result` string.
