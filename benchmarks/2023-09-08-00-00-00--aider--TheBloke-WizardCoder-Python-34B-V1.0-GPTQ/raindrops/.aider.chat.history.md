#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.  
#### A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.  
#### The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation][modulo].  
####   
#### The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:  
####   
#### - has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.  
#### - has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.  
#### - has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.  
#### - _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".  
#### - 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".  
#### - 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".  
####

#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: raindrops.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the updated content of the files:

raindrops.py
```python
def convert(number):
    result = ""
    if number % 3 == 0:
        result += "Pling"
    if number % 5 == 0:
        result += "Plang"
    if number % 7 == 0:
        result += "Plong"
    if result == "":
        result = str(number)
    return result
```

This updated function will convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. If the number is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, the result will be the digits of the number.
