#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage a game player's High Score list.  
####   
#### Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.  
#### Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the updated content of the files:

high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]

    def scores_list(self):
        return self.scores
```

The errors were resolved by adding the missing methods and attributes to the `HighScores` class.
