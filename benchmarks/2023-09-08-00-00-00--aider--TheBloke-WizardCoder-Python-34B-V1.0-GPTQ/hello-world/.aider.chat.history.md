#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The classical introductory exercise.  
#### Just say "Hello, World!".  
####   
#### ["Hello, World!"][hello-world] is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.  
####   
#### The objectives are simple:  
####   
#### - Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".  
#### - Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.  
#### - Submit your solution and check it at the website.  
####   
#### If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hello_world.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

## Solution

The provided code is a Python function that returns the string "Goodbye, Mars!". We need to modify it to return "Hello, World!" instead.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

We can test this function by calling it and printing the result:

```python
print(hello())
```

This should output:

```
Hello, World!
```

We can also run the provided test suite to make sure that our solution works correctly:

```python
import unittest

class TestHelloWorld(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hello(self):
        self.assertEqual(hello(), 'Hello, World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test suite defines a single test case that checks if the `hello()` function returns the expected string. If the test passes, the output should be:

```
.

Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

If the test fails, the output will include a message indicating the reason for the failure.

> Applied edit to hello_world.py
