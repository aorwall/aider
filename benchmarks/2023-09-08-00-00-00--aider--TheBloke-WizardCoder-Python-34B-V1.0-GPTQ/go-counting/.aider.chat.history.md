#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the scored points on a Go board.  
####   
#### In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.  
#### The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.  
####   
#### Write a function that determines the territory of each player.  
#### You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.  
####   
#### Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.  
####   
#### Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.  
#### In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).  
#### Empty spaces represent empty intersections.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### +----+  
#### |IOOI|  
#### |O  O|  
#### |O OI|  
#### |IOI |  
#### +----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the coordinates for the piece are invalid  
#### raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: go_counting.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the import statement in go_counting_test.py. Specifically, it cannot import the name 'WHITE' from go_counting.py.

Looking at the code in go_counting.py, there is no definition for WHITE. It seems like the constant should be defined as 'W' instead.

To fix the error, change the import statement in go_counting_test.py to:

```
from go_counting import (
    Board,
    WHITE,
    BLACK,
    EMPTY,
    territory,
    territories,
)
```

to:

```
from go_counting import (
    Board,
    W as WHITE,
    B as BLACK,
    E as EMPTY,
    territory,
    territories,
)
```

This will correctly import the constants as 'W', 'B', and 'E', and alias them as 'WHITE', 'BLACK', and 'EMPTY', respectively.
