#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.  
####   
#### A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  
####   
#### Note that 1 is not a prime number.  
####   
#### ## Example  
####   
#### What are the prime factors of 60?  
####   
#### - Our first divisor is 2.  
####   2 goes into 60, leaving 30.  
#### - 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.  
####   - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.  
####     So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.  
#### - 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.  
####   - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 4.  
####   - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 5.  
#### - 5 does go cleanly into 5.  
#### - We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.  
####   
#### Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.  
####   
#### You can check this yourself:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 2 * 2 * 3 * 5  
#### = 4 * 15  
#### = 60  
#### ```  
####   
#### Success!  
####

Here is the updated content of the files:

prime_factors.py
```python
def factors(value):
    factors_list = []
    divisor = 2
    while divisor <= value:
        if value % divisor == 0:
            factors_list.append(divisor)
            value //= divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1
    return factors_list
```

This implementation computes the prime factors of a given natural number using a while loop and the modulo operator. It starts with a divisor of 2 and checks if it goes cleanly into the value. If it does, it adds the divisor to the factors list and updates the value by dividing it with the divisor. If it doesn't, it moves on to the next divisor. The loop continues until the value is reduced to 1.
