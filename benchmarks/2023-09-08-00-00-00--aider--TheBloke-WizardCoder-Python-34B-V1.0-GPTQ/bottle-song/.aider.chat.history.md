#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.  
####   
#### Note that not all verses are identical.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,

#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,

#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.

#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.  
####

Here's the modified `bottle_song.py` file with the updated function:

```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    verses = []
    for i in range(start, start - take, -1):
        verses.append(_verse(i))
    return verses

def _verse(num_bottles):
    if num_bottles == 1:
        return "One green bottle hanging on the wall,\nOne green bottle hanging on the wall,\nAnd if one green bottle should accidentally fall,\nThere'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall."
    else:
        return f"{num_bottles} green bottles hanging on the wall,\n{num_bottles} green bottles hanging on the wall,\nAnd if one green bottle should accidentally fall,\nThere'll be {num_bottles - 1} green bottles hanging on the wall."

# Test the function
print(recite(10))
```

This updated function will return a list of verses starting from the given `start` number of bottles and taking `take` number of verses. The `_verse` function is used to generate the verse for a given number of bottles.
