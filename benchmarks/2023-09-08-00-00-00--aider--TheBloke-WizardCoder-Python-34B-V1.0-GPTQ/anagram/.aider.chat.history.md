#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.  
#### A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.  
####   
#### Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.  
####   
#### The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).  
#### Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.  
#### The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).  
#### Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.  
####   
#### Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the modified content of the files:

anagram.py
```python
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    def is_anagram(word1, word2):
        return sorted(word1.lower()) == sorted(word2.lower())

    def is_same_case(word1, word2):
        return word1.lower() == word2.lower()

    anagram_set = []
    for candidate in candidates:
        if is_anagram(word, candidate) and not is_same_case(word, candidate):
            anagram_set.append(candidate)

    return anagram_set
```

This implementation defines two helper functions, `is_anagram` and `is_same_case`, to check if two words are anagrams and have the same case, respectively. The main function `find_anagrams` iterates through the candidates, checks if they are anagrams of the target word and have a different case, and appends them to the anagram set if they meet both conditions.
