#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.  
####   
#### An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.  
####   
#### Examples of isograms:  
####   
#### - lumberjacks  
#### - background  
#### - downstream  
#### - six-year-old  
####   
#### The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here is the updated content of the files:

isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.lower()
    for char in string:
        if char.isalpha() and string.count(char) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This implementation checks if each character in the string appears only once, ignoring spaces and hyphens. The function returns `True` if the string is an isogram, and `False` otherwise.
