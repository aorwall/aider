prompt:
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.
A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.

Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.

The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).
Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.
The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).
Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.

Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: anagram.py
```python
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    pass

```


### Response:
Filepath: anagram.py
