Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: triangle.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python

```

### Response:
Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a == b == c


def isosceles(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a == b or b == c or a == c


def scalene(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a != b != c != a

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in triangle.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a == b == c


def isosceles(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a == b or b == c or a == c


def scalene(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a != b != c != a

```
