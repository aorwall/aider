Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```


### Instruction:
# Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.
So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.
Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

| Name   | Dialogue                    |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |
| Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |
| Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |
|        | One for you, one for me.    |
| Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |
