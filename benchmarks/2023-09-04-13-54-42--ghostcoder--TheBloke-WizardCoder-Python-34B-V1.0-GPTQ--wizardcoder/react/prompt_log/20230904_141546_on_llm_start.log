prompt:
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Implement a basic reactive system.

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how values are computed in terms of each other to allow a change to one value to automatically propagate to other values, like in a spreadsheet.

Implement a basic reactive system with cells with settable values ("input" cells) and cells with values computed in terms of other cells ("compute" cells).
Implement updates so that when an input value is changed, values propagate to reach a new stable system state.

In addition, compute cells should allow for registering change notification callbacks.
Call a cell’s callbacks when the cell’s value in a new stable state has changed from the previous stable state.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: react.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: react.py
```python
class InputCell:
    def __init__(self, initial_value):
        self.value = None


class ComputeCell:
    def __init__(self, inputs, compute_function):
        self.value = None

    def add_callback(self, callback):
        pass

    def remove_callback(self, callback):
        pass
    
```


### Response:
Filepath: react.py
```python
