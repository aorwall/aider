See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in food_chain.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: food_chain.py
```python
def recite(start_verse=1, end_verse=8):
    verses = []

    for i in range(start_verse, end_verse + 1):
        verse = f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {foods[i - 1]}."

        if i > 1:
            verse += f" She swallowed the {foods[i - 2]} to catch the {foods[i - 1]}.
