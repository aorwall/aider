# Instructions

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.

To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

- to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
- to list the different band colors

Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:
Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.

More information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: resistor_color.py
```python
def color_code(color):
    pass


def colors():
    pass

```
