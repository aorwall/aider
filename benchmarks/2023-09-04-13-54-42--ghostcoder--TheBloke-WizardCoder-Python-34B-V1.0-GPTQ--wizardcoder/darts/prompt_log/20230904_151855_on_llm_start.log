```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py

        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):

# Instructions

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

[Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: darts.py
```python
def score(x, y):
    pass

```


### Response:
