# Instructions

Refactor a tree building algorithm.

Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.
However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.
Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.

Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.
The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.
The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).
All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.

An example tree:

```text
root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)
|-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)
|    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)
|    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)
+-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)
|    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)
+-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.
