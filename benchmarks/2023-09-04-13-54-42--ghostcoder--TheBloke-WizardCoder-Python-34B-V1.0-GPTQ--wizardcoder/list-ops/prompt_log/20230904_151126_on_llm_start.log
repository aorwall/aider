Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```

# Instructions

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and `reduce` are very common.
Implement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.

The precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general operations you will implement include:

- `append` (*given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list*);
- `concatenate` (*given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list*);
- `filter` (*given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True*);
- `length` (*given a list, return the total number of items within it*);
- `map` (*given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items*);
- `foldl` (*given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left*);
- `foldr` (*given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right*);
- `reverse` (*given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order*).

Note, the ordering in which arguments are passed to the fold functions (`foldl`, `foldr`) is significant.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: list_ops.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: list_ops.py
```python
def append(list1, list2):
    pass


def concat(lists):
    pass


def filter(function, list):
    pass


def length(list):
    pass


def map(function, list):
    pass


def foldl(function, list, initial):
    pass


def foldr(function, list, initial):
    pass


def reverse(list):
    pass

```


### Response:
