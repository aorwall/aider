prompt:
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;
the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the slice length is zero.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")

# if the slice length is negative.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")

# if the series provided is empty.
raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

# if the slice length is longer than the series.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: series.py
```python

```

### Response:
Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    if len(series) < 1:
        raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

    if length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero or negative")

    if length > len(series):
        raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")

    return [series[i:i+length] for i in range(len(series)-length+1)]

```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in series.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    if len(series) < 1:
        raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

    if length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero or negative")

    if length > len(series):
        raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")

    return [series[i:i+length] for i in range(len(series)-length+1)]

```


### Response:
