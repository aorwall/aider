prompt:
Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: factorial.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Response:
Filepath: palindrome_checker.py
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Instruction:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
```

### Response:
Filepath: shapes.py
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains these 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text


   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text


+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text

  ++
  ++


```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of every line equals the length of the first line).

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rectangles.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: rectangles.py
```python
def rectangles(strings):
    pass

```


### Response:
Filepath: rectangles.py
```python
