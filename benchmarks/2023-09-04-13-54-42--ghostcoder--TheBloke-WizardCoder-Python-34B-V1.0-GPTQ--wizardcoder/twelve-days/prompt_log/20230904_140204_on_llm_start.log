Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.
Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.

The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.

## Test-driven development

 Be sure to check the comments at the top of the tests file.
 They will be helpful in understanding the expected output of your function.

This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.
However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.
For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.
For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.
What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve_days.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from existing unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: twelve_days.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    pass

```


### Response:
Filepath: twelve_days.py
