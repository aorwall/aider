Solution:
We need to recursively traverse the input list and append non-nil elements to a new list.
If an element is itself a list, call the `flatten` function on it and extend its output to our result list. If it is None, skip it.

Here's the implementation: 

```python
def flatten(iterable):
    """
    Flattens a nested list-like structure into a flat list.
    Removes all None values from the resulting list.
    """
    result = []
    for item in iterable:
        if type(item) == list:
            result += flatten(item)
        elif item != None:
            result.append(item)
    return result
```

This solution uses recursion to handle arbitrarily deep nesting. It checks whether the current item is a list, and if so calls `flatten()` on it again. Otherwise, it appends the item to the result list only if it is not None. We could also check for other falsy values like empty strings or False instead of just None, but since the prompt specifies "nil" specifically, I assumed that means None.
