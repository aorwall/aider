Here's one possible implementation for `resistor_color_duo.py`:

```python
def value(colors):
    # Create a dictionary mapping color codes to numbers
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    
    # Convert the list of colors into a string with only the first two elements
    code = ''.join([str(color_codes[c]) for c in colors[:2]])
    
    # Return the corresponding numerical value
    return int(code)
```

This solution uses a dictionary to map color names to their respective codes, converts the first two colors in the given list to digits, concatenates them into a string, and returns the resulting number.


Note that we assume here that the input `colors` is always at least 2 characters long, since otherwise there wouldn't be enough information to determine a unique value. If you wanted to handle inputs of different lengths differently, you could add some error checking before converting the colors to digits. For example:


```python
if len(colors) < 2:
    raise ValueError("Not enough colors")
```

Also note that this implementation assumes that the input is already validated and contains only valid color names. You may want to add additional checks to ensure that all input values are recognized colors.
