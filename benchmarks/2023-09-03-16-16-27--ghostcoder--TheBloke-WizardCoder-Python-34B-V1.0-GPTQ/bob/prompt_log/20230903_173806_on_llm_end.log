Here's an implementation of `response` function based on the given requirements:

```python
def response(hey_bob):
    # Check if input contains uppercase letters (i.e., yelling)
    if hey_bob.strip().isupper():
        if '?' in hey_bob:
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else:
            return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob == '' or hey_bob.isspace() or len(hey_bob) == 0:
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    elif '?' in hey_bob:
        return "Sure."
    else:
        return "Whatever."
```

This function checks whether the input string has uppercase letters, which indicates yelling. If so, it returns either "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" or "Whoa, chill out!". If there's no content in the input string or it consists solely of whitespace characters, it returns "Fine. Be that way!". Otherwise, it returns "Sure." if the input ends with a question mark, otherwise it returns "Whatever.".


Note that this implementation assumes that all inputs are strings. It also ignores cases where the input starts with lowercase letters but includes uppercase ones later on (such as "I am FINE"), since those would technically count as yelling. However, the prompt does not specify handling such cases.
