Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Introduction

Bob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.
He likes to think that he's very cool.
And he definitely doesn't get excited about things.
That wouldn't be cool.

When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical
# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: bob.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's an implementation of `response` function based on the given requirements:
Filepath: bob.py
```
def response(hey_bob):
    # Check if input contains uppercase letters (i.e., yelling)
    if hey_bob.strip().isupper():
        if '?' in hey_bob:
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else:
            return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob == '' or hey_bob.isspace() or len(hey_bob) == 0:
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    elif '?' in hey_bob:
        return "Sure."
    else:
        return "Whatever."

```

This function checks whether the input string has uppercase letters, which indicates yelling. If so, it returns either "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" or "Whoa, chill out!". If there's no content in the input string or it consists solely of whitespace characters, it returns "Fine. Be that way!". Otherwise, it returns "Sure." if the input ends with a question mark, otherwise it returns "Whatever.".


Note that this implementation assumes that all inputs are strings. It also ignores cases where the input starts with lowercase letters but includes uppercase ones later on (such as "I am FINE"), since those would technically count as yelling. However, the prompt does not specify handling such cases.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bob.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bob.py
```python
def response(hey_bob):
    # Check if input contains uppercase letters (i.e., yelling)
    if hey_bob.strip().isupper():
        if '?' in hey_bob:
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else:
            return "Whoa, chill out!"
    elif hey_bob == '' or hey_bob.isspace() or len(hey_bob) == 0:
        return "Fine. Be that way!"
    elif '?' in hey_bob:
        return "Sure."
    else:
        return "Whatever."

```
