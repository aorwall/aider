Be that way!\"**\n  This is how he responds to silence.\n  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.\n- **\"Whatever.\"**\n  This is what he answers to anything else.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bob.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
