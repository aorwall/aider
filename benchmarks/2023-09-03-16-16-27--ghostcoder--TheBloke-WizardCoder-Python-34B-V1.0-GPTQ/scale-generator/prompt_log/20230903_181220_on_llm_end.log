Great job! You found and fixed both issues with the `Scale` class. The first issue was that we were trying to access an element from `_notes` using `'d'` instead of `'D'`, which caused a `KeyError`. We can fix this by converting the input string to uppercase before searching for it. The second issue was that we didn't handle the case where the user inputs an invalid interval character, so we should add a check for that as well. Here's the corrected implementation:


```python
class Scale:
    def __init__(self, tonic):
        self.tonic = tonic.upper()
        self._notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B'] # all notes in order on the keyboard
        self._intervals = {'M': 2, '#': 1, 'm': -1} # mapping of interval names to their corresponding number of semitones


    def chromatic(self):
        """Returns the chromatic scale starting at the tonic"""
        index = self._notes.index(self.tonic)
        return [note for note in self._notes[index:] + self._notes[:index]]

    
    def interval(self, intervals):
        """Generates a new scale based on the given sequence of intervals"""
        result = []
        current = self.chromatic().index(self.tonic)
        result.append(self._notes[current])
        for i in intervals:
            if i not in self._intervals:
                raise ValueError("Invalid interval")
            current += self._intervals.get(i, 0)
            result.append(self._notes[current % len(self._notes)]
        return result
```

Now let's run the tests again:

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest discover -v -p "*_test.py"
...
