### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

The dice game [Yacht][yacht] is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.
In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered in any of twelve categories.
The score of a throw of the dice depends on category chosen.

## Scores in Yacht

| Category | Score | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| Ones | 1 × number of ones | Any combination | 1 1 1 4 5 scores 3 |
| Twos | 2 × number of twos | Any combination | 2 2 3 4 5 scores 4 |
| Threes | 3 × number of threes | Any combination | 3 3 3 3 3 scores 15 |
| Fours | 4 × number of fours | Any combination | 1 2 3 3 5 scores 0 |
| Fives | 5 × number of fives| Any combination | 5 1 5 2 5 scores 15 |
| Sixes | 6 × number of sixes | Any combination | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 6 |
| Full House | Total of the dice | Three of one number and two of another | 3 3 3 5 5 scores 19 |
| Four of a Kind | Total of the four dice | At least four dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 6 scores 16 |
| Little Straight |  30 points | 1-2-3-4-5 | 1 2 3 4 5 scores 30 |
| Big Straight | 30 points | 2-3-4-5-6 | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 30 |
| Choice | Sum of the dice | Any combination | 2 3 3 4 6 scores 18 |
| Yacht | 50 points | All five dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 4 scores 50 |

If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of a category, the score is zero.
If, for example, *Four Of A Kind* is entered in the *Yacht* category, zero points are scored.
A *Yacht* scores zero if entered in the *Full House* category.

## Task

Given a list of values for five dice and a category, your solution should return the score of the dice for that category.
If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of the category your solution should return 0.
You can assume that five values will always be presented, and the value of each will be between one and six inclusively.
You should not assume that the dice are ordered.

Here's an implementation of `score` function based on the given rules:
Filepath: yacht.py
```
# Score categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
YACHT = 'yacht'
ONES = 'ones'
TWOS = 'twos'
THREES = 'threes'
FOURS = 'fours'
FIVES = 'fives'
SIXES = 'sixes'
FULL_HOUSE = 'full house'
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = 'four of a kind'
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = 'little straight'
BIG_STRAIGHT = 'big straight'
CHOICE = 'choice'


def count_occurrences(dice):
    """Count occurrences of each number in the dice."""
    counts = {}
    for num in range(1, 7):
        counts[num] = 0
    for die in dice:
        counts[die] += 1
    return counts


def score(dice, category):
    # Sort the dice so we can check for straights easily.
    sorted_dice = sorted(dice)

    def all_same():
        return len(set(dice)) == 1

    def full_house():
        counts = count_occurrences(dice)
        return (all_same() or set(counts.values()) == {2, 3}) and sum(counts.values()) == 5

    def little_straight():
        return sorted_dice == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    def big_straight():
        return sorted_dice == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    def choice():
        return sum(dice)

    def yacht():
        return 50 if all_same() else 0

    def ones():
        return dice.count(1) * 1

    def twos():
        return dice.count(2) * 2

    def threes():
        return dice.count(3) * 3

    def fours():
        return dice.count(4) * 4

    def fives():
        return dice.count(5) * 5

    def sixes():
        return dice.count(6) * 6

    switcher = {
        YACHT: yacht,
        ONES: ones,
        TWOS: twos,

        SIXES: sixes,
        FULL_HOUSE: lambda: 25 if full_house() else 0,
        LITTLE_STRAIGHT: lambda: 30 if little_straight() else 0,
        BIG_STRAIGHT: lambda: 30 if big_straight() else 0,
        CHOICE: choice,
    }

    return switcher.get(category, lambda: 0)()

```

We first define helper functions to count the occurrences of each number in the dice and determine whether there's a full house or a straight. Then, we create a dictionary mapping each category to its corresponding scoring function. Finally, we use this dictionary to look up the correct function and call it with no arguments to get the score. If the category isn't recognized, we default to returning 0. Note that we multiply the count by the appropriate factor for the single number categories (`ones`, `twos`, etc.) but add up the dice directly for `choice`. We also handle the case where the input doesn't match any known category using the `lambda: 0` syntax, which returns 0 unconditionally.
