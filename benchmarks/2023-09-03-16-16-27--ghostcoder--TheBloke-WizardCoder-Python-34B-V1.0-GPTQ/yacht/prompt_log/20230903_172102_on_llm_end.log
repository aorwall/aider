Here's an implementation of `score` function based on the given rules:

```python
# Score categories.
YACHT = 'yacht'
ONES = 'ones'
TWOS = 'twos'
THREES = 'threes'
FOURS = 'fours'
FIVES = 'fives'
SIXES = 'sixes'
FULL_HOUSE = 'full house'
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = 'four of a kind'
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = 'little straight'
BIG_STRAIGHT = 'big straight'
CHOICE = 'choice'


def count_occurrences(dice):
    """Count occurrences of each number in the dice."""
    counts = {}
    for num in range(1, 7):
        counts[num] = 0
    for die in dice:
        counts[die] += 1
    return counts


def score(dice, category):
    # Sort the dice so we can check for straights easily.
    sorted_dice = sorted(dice)
    
    def all_same():
        return len(set(dice)) == 1
    
    def full_house():
        counts = count_occurrences(dice)
        return (all_same() or set(counts.values()) == {2, 3}) and sum(counts.values()) == 5
    
    def little_straight():
        return sorted_dice == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    def big_straight():
        return sorted_dice == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    def choice():
        return sum(dice)
    
    def yacht():
        return 50 if all_same() else 0
    
    def ones():
        return dice.count(1) * 1
    
    def twos():
        return dice.count(2) * 2
    
    def threes():
        return dice.count(3) * 3
    
    def fours():
        return dice.count(4) * 4
    
    def fives():
        return dice.count(5) * 5
    
    def sixes():
        return dice.count(6) * 6
    
    switcher = {
        YACHT: yacht,
        ONES: ones,
        TWOS: twos,
        THREES: threes,
        FOURS: fours,
        FIVES: fives,
        SIXES: sixes,
        FULL_HOUSE: lambda: 25 if full_house() else 0,
        LITTLE_STRAIGHT: lambda: 30 if little_straight() else 0,
        BIG_STRAIGHT: lambda: 30 if big_straight() else 0,
        CHOICE: choice,
    }
    
    return switcher.get(category, lambda: 0)()
```

We first define helper functions to count the occurrences of each number in the dice and determine whether there's a full house or a straight. Then, we create a dictionary mapping each category to its corresponding scoring function. Finally, we use this dictionary to look up the correct function and call it with no arguments to get the score. If the category isn't recognized, we default to returning 0. Note that we multiply the count by the appropriate factor for the single number categories (`ones`, `twos`, etc.) but add up the dice directly for `choice`. We also handle the case where the input doesn't match any known category using the `lambda: 0` syntax, which returns 0 unconditionally.
