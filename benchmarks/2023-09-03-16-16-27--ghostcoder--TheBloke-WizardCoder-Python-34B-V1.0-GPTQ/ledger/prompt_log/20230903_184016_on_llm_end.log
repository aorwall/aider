The code looks good! It is well-written and easy to read. The function `get_table` takes in a list of entries and returns the formatted string for displaying them as a table. It uses the `currency` parameter to determine which format to use (USD or EUR), and it handles both positive and negative values correctly by adding a `-` sign when necessary. The formatting ensures that each column has a fixed width of 13 characters, so they all line up properly. Overall, this is a great solution.
