### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed.
All known life depends on DNA!

> Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.

DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.
A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!
We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".

We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.
'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.

For example:

```text
"GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2
"INVALID" -> error
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nucleotide_count.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: nucleotide_count.py
```python

```

### Response:
To solve this problem we can iterate over the input string and keep track of the number of occurrences of each nucleotide using a dictionary. We can initialize the dictionary with keys for all possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T) and values of zero. Then, we can loop through the string and increment the corresponding key in the dictionary if the current character matches one of the nucleotides. Finally, we can return the dictionary containing the counts. If there are any non-valid characters in the string, we raise a ValueError exception. Here's the implementation:
Filepath: nucleotide_count.py
```
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    """Counts the number of occurrences of a specific nucleotide in a given strand."""
    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA strand")

    count = 0
    for char in strand:
        if char == nucleotide:
            count += 1

    return count


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    """Returns a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide in a given strand."""
    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA strand")

    counts = {
        'A': 0,
        'C': 0,
        'G': 0,
        'T': 0
    }

    for char in strand:
        counts[char] += 1

    return counts

```

The `count` function takes two arguments: a string `strand` and a string `nucleotide`. It returns the number of times `nucleotide` occurs in `strand`. We first check whether `strand` contains only valid characters (i.e., A, C, G, T). If not, we raise a `ValueError` exception.

Inside the `nucletide_counts` function, we also check if `strand` contains only valid characters before initializing a dictionary with zeros for each nucleotide. We then loop through `strand`, update the count for each nucleotide accordingly, and return the resulting dictionary.

Note that we could have used the `collections.Counter()` method instead of manually counting the nucleotides but since we're not allowed to import any modules, we'll stick to the manual approach.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in nucleotide_count.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: nucleotide_count.py
```python

    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:

    count = 0
    for char in strand:
        if char == nucleotide:
            count += 1

    return count


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    """Returns a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide in a given strand."""
    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:

    counts = {
        'A': 0,
        'C': 0,
