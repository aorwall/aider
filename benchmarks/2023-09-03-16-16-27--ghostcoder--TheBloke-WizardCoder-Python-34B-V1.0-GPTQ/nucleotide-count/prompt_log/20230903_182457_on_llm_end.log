To solve this problem we can iterate over the input string and keep track of the number of occurrences of each nucleotide using a dictionary. We can initialize the dictionary with keys for all possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T) and values of zero. Then, we can loop through the string and increment the corresponding key in the dictionary if the current character matches one of the nucleotides. Finally, we can return the dictionary containing the counts. If there are any non-valid characters in the string, we raise a ValueError exception. Here's the implementation:


```python
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    """Counts the number of occurrences of a specific nucleotide in a given strand."""
    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA strand")
    
    count = 0
    for char in strand:
        if char == nucleotide:
            count += 1
    
    return count


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    """Returns a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide in a given strand."""
    valid_chars = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}
    if len(set(strand) - valid_chars) > 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA strand")
    
    counts = {
        'A': 0,
        'C': 0,
        'G': 0,
        'T': 0
    }
    
    for char in strand:
        counts[char] += 1
    
    return counts
```

The `count` function takes two arguments: a string `strand` and a string `nucleotide`. It returns the number of times `nucleotide` occurs in `strand`. We first check whether `strand` contains only valid characters (i.e., A, C, G, T). If not, we raise a `ValueError` exception.

Inside the `nucletide_counts` function, we also check if `strand` contains only valid characters before initializing a dictionary with zeros for each nucleotide. We then loop through `strand`, update the count for each nucleotide accordingly, and return the resulting dictionary.

Note that we could have used the `collections.Counter()` method instead of manually counting the nucleotides but since we're not allowed to import any modules, we'll stick to the manual approach.
