Here's the corrected implementation of `isbn_verifier.py`:

```python
import re

def is_valid(isbn):
    # Remove all non-numeric characters and convert remaining characters to integers
    digits = [int(c) if c != "X" else 10 for c in re.sub(r'\D', '', isbn)]

    # Check that there are exactly 10 digits left after removing non-numeric characters
    if len(digits) != 10:
        return False

    # Calculate the sum of each digit multiplied by its position weight
    total = sum([digits[i] * (10 - i) for i in range(len(digits))])

    return total % 11 == 0
```

Explanation:

- The regular expression `\D` matches any character that is not a digit.
- We use it with `re.sub()` to remove all non-numeric characters from the input string `isbn`. This leaves only numeric characters or 'X'.
- If the resulting list has length other than 10, we know that the ISBN is invalid because it doesn't have enough digits.
- We then calculate the checksum as before using the same formula as in the original implementation.
- Note that we don't need to handle the case where an 'X' appears at an index different from 9 separately; since it represents the value 10, it will be treated correctly when multiplied by its position weight.

Now let's run the tests again:

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest isbn_verifier_test.py
