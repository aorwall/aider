Here's the modified code for sublist.py:

```python
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary, but unique value.
An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory efficient. It is a common 
practice to export both constants and functions that work with those constants (ex. 
the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

"""

# Possible sublist categories. Do not modify these values!
SUBLIST = "sublist"
SUPERLIST = "superlist"
EQUAL = "equal"
UNEQUAL = "unequal"


def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    """
    Determines if one list is a sublist of another list.

    Args:
        list_one: A list of integers.
        list_two: Another list of integers.

    Returns:
        SUBLIST, SUPERLIST, EQUAL or UNEQUAL depending on whether list_one is a sublist,
            superlist, or equal to list_two respectively.
    """
    # Check if lists are equal
    if len(list_one) == len(list_two) and sorted(list_one) == sorted(list_two):
        return EQUAL
    
    # Check if list_one is a sublist of list_two
    elif all([elem in list_two for elem in list_one]):
        return SUBLIST
    
    # Check if list_one is a superlist of list_two
    elif all([elem in list_one for elem in list_two]):
        return SUPERLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
```

We first check if the two lists are equal by comparing their lengths and sorting them. If they have the same length and elements, we know they are equal.
If not, we check if all elements of list_one are present in list_two using the `all()` method. This returns True only if all elements of list_one are found in list_two.
Similarly, we check if all elements of list_two are present in list_one to determine if list_one is a superlist of list_two.
Otherwise, the two lists must be unequal. We return the corresponding constant based on which condition satisfies.
