### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:

- List `A` is equal to list `B`; or
- List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or
- List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or
- None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal

Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.
List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.
List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.

Examples:

- If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`
- If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal
- If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal

Here's the modified code for sublist.py:

```
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary, but unique value.
An integer is traditionally used because it’s memory efficient. It is a common 
practice to export both constants and functions that work with those constants (ex. 
the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

```

We first check if the two lists are equal by comparing their lengths and sorting them. If they have the same length and elements, we know they are equal.
If not, we check if all elements of list_one are present in list_two using the `all()` method. This returns True only if all elements of list_one are found in list_two.
Similarly, we check if all elements of list_two are present in list_one to determine if list_one is a superlist of list_two.
Otherwise, the two lists must be unequal. We return the corresponding constant based on which condition satisfies.
