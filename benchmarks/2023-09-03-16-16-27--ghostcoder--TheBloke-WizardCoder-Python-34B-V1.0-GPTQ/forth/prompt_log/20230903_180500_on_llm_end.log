The `evaluate` function takes an input string and evaluates the expression using a stack-based approach. It uses a dictionary to store operators and their corresponding functions that take two arguments (except for `dup`, which only needs one argument). The `try`-`except` blocks handle errors such as division by 0, invalid operators, and underflow errors when trying to access elements from an empty stack. Here's how you can use it:

```python
>>> evaluate("3 4 +")
7
>>> evaluate("5 6 * 2 /")
1
>>> evaluate("10 3 /")
3
>>> evaluate("10 0 /") # raises ZeroDivisionError
ZeroDivisionError: Cannot divide by zero
>>> evaluate("a b +") # raises ValueError
ValueError: "a" is not a valid operator or operand
```

Note that this implementation does not support parentheses or order of operations. If you need more complex expressions with multiple operators, consider using the `shunting yard algorithm` or another parsing technique.
