The provided implementation of the `find()` function is incomplete. It needs to perform a binary search on the input `search_list` to locate the index of the first occurrence of the target `value`. If the `value` is present multiple times in the list, return the index of its first occurrence. If the `value` is not present in the list, raise a `ValueError` with the message "value not in array". Here's how you can complete the implementation:


```python
def find(search_list, value):
    """Perform a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of the value in the search_list.
    
    Args:
        search_list (list): A sorted list of integers.
        value (int): An integer to search for in the search_list.
    
    Returns:
        int: Index of the first occurrence of the value in the search_list.
            Raises a ValueError if the value is not found in the list.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if search_list[mid] == value:
            # Check if this is the first occurrence of the value
            if mid == 0 or search_list[mid - 1] != value:
                return mid
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        elif search_list[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    raise ValueError("value not in array")
```

We initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, at the beginning and end of the list respectively. Then, we keep dividing the list into halves until we either find the value or determine that it's not there. At each iteration, we check whether the middle element matches the target value. If it does, we need to make sure it's the first occurrence of the value. If it is, we return its index. Otherwise, we update the boundaries based on whether the value is smaller or larger than the middle element and continue searching in the appropriate half of the list.


Note that we also handle the case where the value is not found in the list using a try-except block. In Python, we can catch exceptions using the `try`-`except` construct. If no exception occurs during execution of the `try` block, nothing happens. But if an exception is raised, control is transferred to the corresponding `except` block which handles it. In this case, we catch the `ValueError` exception and re-raise it with a custom message.
