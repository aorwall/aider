When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the given value is not found within the array. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# example when value is not found in the array.\nraise ValueError(\"value not in array\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

If it does, we need to make sure it's the first occurrence of the value. If it is, we return its index.

In Python, we can catch exceptions using the `try`-`except` construct. If no exception occurs during execution of the `try` block, nothing happens. But if an exception is raised, control is transferred to the corresponding `except` block which handles it. In this case, we catch the `ValueError` exception and re-raise it with a custom message.",
