### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.
# Instructions append

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.

- [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)
- [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's an implementation of the `HighScores` class that keeps track of the current high scores and provides methods to retrieve the top scores:
Filepath: high_scores.py
```
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = sorted(scores)


    def get_highest(self):
        """Returns the highest score."""
        if len(self.scores) > 0:
            return self.scores[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No scores available.")


    def get_last(self):
        """Returns the last added score."""
        if len(self.scores) > 0:
            return self.scores[0]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No scores available.")


    def get_top_three(self):
        """Returns the three highest scores."""
        if len(self.scores) >= 3:
            return self.scores[:3][::-1]
        elif len(self.scores) == 2:
            return self.scores[::-1]
        elif len(self.scores) == 1:
            return self.scores
        else:
            raise ValueError("Not enough scores available.")

```

The `__init__()` method takes a list of initial scores and sorts it in descending order.

The `get_highest()` method returns the highest score at index -1, which corresponds to the first element since the list is sorted in descending order.

The `get_last()` method returns the last added score at index 0, which corresponds to the first element after sorting.

The `get_top_three()` method returns the first three elements of the sorted list in reverse order, so that the highest scores come first. If there are less than three scores, it returns all of them.

Note that I used exception handling to avoid errors when trying to access empty lists or lists with fewer than three elements. You can customize these messages to fit your needs.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = sorted(scores)


    def get_highest(self):
        """Returns the highest score."""
        if len(self.scores) > 0:
            return self.scores[-1]

            raise ValueError("No scores available.")


    def get_last(self):
