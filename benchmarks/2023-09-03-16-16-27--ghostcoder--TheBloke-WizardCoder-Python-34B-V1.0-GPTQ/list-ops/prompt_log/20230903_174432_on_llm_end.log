Here's the implementation of the required list operations:

```python
def append(list1, list2):
    """Given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list."""
    return list1 + list2


def concatenate(lists):
    """Given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list."""
    result = []
    for lst in lists:
        result += lst
    return result

def filter(function, lst):
    """Given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True."""
    return [x for x in lst if function(x)]

def length(lst):
    """Given a list, return the total number of items within it."""
    count = 0
    for _ in lst:
        count += 1
    return count

def map(func, lst):
    """Given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items."""
    return [func(x) for x in lst]

def foldl(func, lst, acc):
    """Given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left."""
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        acc = func(acc, lst[i])
    return acc

def foldr(func, lst, acc):
    """Given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right."""
    for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1):
        acc = func(lst[i], acc)
    return acc

def reverse(lst):
    """Given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order."""
    return lst[::-1]
```

We can test these implementations by running the provided unittest file:

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest list_ops_test.py
