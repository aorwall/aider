Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and `reduce` are very common.
Implement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.

The precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general operations you will implement include:

- `append` (*given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list*);
- `concatenate` (*given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list*);
- `filter` (*given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True*);
- `length` (*given a list, return the total number of items within it*);
- `map` (*given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items*);
- `foldl` (*given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left*);
- `foldr` (*given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right*);
- `reverse` (*given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order*).

Note, the ordering in which arguments are passed to the fold functions (`foldl`, `foldr`) is significant.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: list_ops.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: list_ops.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's the implementation of the required list operations:
Filepath: list_ops.py
```
def append(list1, list2):
    """Given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list."""
    return list1 + list2


def concatenate(lists):
    """Given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list."""
    result = []
    for lst in lists:
        result += lst
    return result

def filter(function, lst):
    """Given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True."""
    return [x for x in lst if function(x)]

def length(lst):
    """Given a list, return the total number of items within it."""
    count = 0
    for _ in lst:
        count += 1
    return count

def map(func, lst):
    """Given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items."""
    return [func(x) for x in lst]

def foldl(func, lst, acc):
    """Given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left."""
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        acc = func(acc, lst[i])
    return acc

def foldr(func, lst, acc):
    """Given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right."""
    for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1):
        acc = func(lst[i], acc)
    return acc

def reverse(lst):
    """Given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order."""
    return lst[::-1]


def concat(lists):
    pass


def filter(function, list):
    pass


def length(list):
    pass


def map(function, list):
    pass


def foldl(function, list, initial):
    pass


def foldr(function, list, initial):
    pass


def reverse(list):
    pass

```
