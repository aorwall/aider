Here is one possible implementation for `combinations`:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    """Return all unique combinations of numbers that add up to target with given size without excluding any number."""
    if size == 1:
        return [[x] for x in range(1, target + 1) if x != exclude]
    else:
        result = []
        for i in range(1, target - (size - 1)):
            sub_result = combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude)
            for combo in sub_result:
                combo.append(i)
                result.append(sorted([*combo]) if i != exclude else sorted(set(combo))
        return result
```

This uses recursion to generate all possible combinations of numbers that add up to `target` with length `size`, while avoiding duplicates.
It starts with the base case where there is only one element left (`size == 1`) and returns a list containing all non-zero integers between 1 and `target`. If `exclude` is present in this list, it removes it before returning.
For larger values of `size`, it generates all combinations of `size - 1` elements recursively, then adds the current value `i` to each combination and appends them to the final result. However, if `i` equals `exclude`, we need to make sure to remove duplicates first before adding it to the result. We do so by converting the combination to a set and back to a list after sorting it.

Note that this solution assumes that `target` is positive and `size` is greater than zero. It also doesn't handle negative numbers or floats. You may want to add some input validation code to ensure these conditions are met.
