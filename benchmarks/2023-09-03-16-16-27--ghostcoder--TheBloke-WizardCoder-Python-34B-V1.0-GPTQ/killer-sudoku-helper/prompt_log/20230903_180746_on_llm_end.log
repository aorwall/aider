I see you have provided the updated code. The issue was indeed related to the missing closing parenthesis at the end of `sorted()` function call. I apologize for not catching it earlier. However, there is still one more issue in your implementation. You need to remove the extra space before "esult" on line 7. It should be "return". Here's the corrected code:

Filepath: killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
from itertools import permutations

def combinations(target, size, exclude):
    """Return all unique combinations of numbers that add up to target with given size without excluding any number."""
    if size == 1:
        return [[x] for x in range(1, target + 1) if x != exclude]
    else:
        result = []
        for i in range(1, target - (size - 1)):
            sub_result = combinations(target - i, size - 1, exclude)
            for combo in sub_result:
                combo.append(i)
                result.append(sorted([*combo]) if i != exclude else sorted(set(combo)))
        return result
```
