Here's a possible implementation of `is_armstrong_number` that passes all the given tests:

```python
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    if number < 0 or number > 10**7: # check for invalid input
        return False
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(number)]
    n = len(digits)
    total = sum([d ** n for d in digits])
    return total == number
```

Explanation:

- We first check whether the input number is within the valid range (0 to 1 million). If it isn't, we immediately return `False`. This prevents potential errors from trying to calculate with large numbers.
- Then we convert the integer into its individual digits using string manipulation and store them as a list of integers (`[int(d)` for d in str(number)]`).
- Next, we compute the length of this list (`len(digits)`) which gives us the number of digits in the original number.
- Finally, we use a list comprehension to raise each digit to the power of the number of digits (`d ** n`) and add up the results (`sum([d ** n for d in digits]`). If this sum equals the original number, then it is an Armstrong number and we return `True`, otherwise we return `False`. Note that we don't need to check whether the result is equal to zero because any number raised to the power of itself will always be positive.
