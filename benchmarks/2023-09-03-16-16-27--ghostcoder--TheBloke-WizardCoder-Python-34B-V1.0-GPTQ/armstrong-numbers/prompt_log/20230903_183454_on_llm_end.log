Solution:
We can solve this problem using the following steps:

1. Convert the input number into string.
2. Find the length of the string (i.e., number of digits).
3. Iterate over each digit of the string and raise it to the power of the length of the string.
4. Sum all the results obtained in step 3.
5. If the sum equals to the original number, then it is an Armstrong number otherwise not.

Let's write the code to implement these steps.<|im_sep|>
