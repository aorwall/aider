This function returns a string containing all the gifts from the current day until the first day, separated by newlines with appropriate punctuations.\n- In this function, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the `gifts` list up to the index corresponding to the current day (`len(gifts) - day`) and capitalize the gift text using the `.capitalize()` method. If it's not the last line, we add a comma at the end except for the last item.\n- We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the final output.\n- For each verse between `start_verse` and `end_verse`, we append the verse number and the corresponding gift text to the `result` list.\n- Finally, we join the lines together with newline characters and return the resulting list. Note that we also added a trailing newline character after each verse to match the expected output format.",
