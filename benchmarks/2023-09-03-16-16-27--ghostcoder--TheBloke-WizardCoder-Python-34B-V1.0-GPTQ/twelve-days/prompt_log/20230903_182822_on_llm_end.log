Here's one possible implementation using string formatting and loops:

```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    days = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", "seventh", "eighth", "ninth", "tenth",
            "eleventh", "twelfth"]
    gifts = ["A partridge in a pear tree.", "Two turtle doves, ", "Three french hens, ", "Four calling birds, ", 
            "Five gold rings, ", "Six geese-a-laying, ", "Seven swans-a-swimming, ", "Eight maids-a-milking, ", 
            "Nine ladies dancing, ", "Ten lords-a-leaping, ", "Eleven pipers piping, ", "Twelve drummers drumming."]
        
    def get_gift_text(day):
        return "\n".join([f"{i+1} {g}" for i, g in enumerate(gifts[:day])]) + (f"\nAnd {gifts[day]}") if day > 0 else ""

    result = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        result += [f"On the {days[i]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me:{get_gift_text(i)}"]
    return result
```

We define lists `days` and `gifts`, then create a helper function `get_gift_text()` that takes an integer argument representing the number of days and returns a formatted string of all the gifts up to that point.
Inside the loop we concatenate the appropriate strings together to form the final list of verses. We subtract 1 from `start_verse` because Python indices start at 0 but the song starts counting at 1.

Note that this implementation assumes that `end_verse` is always greater than or equal to `start_verse`. If you want to handle cases where `end_verse < start_verse`, you can add some error checking logic to ensure that `end_verse >= start_verse` and swap them if necessary.
