Here is the corrected version of `twelve_days.py`:

```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    days = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", "seventh", "eighth", "ninth", "tenth",
            "eleventh", "twelfth"]
    gifts = ["a partridge in a pear tree.", "two turtle doves, ", "three french hens, ", "four calling birds, ", 
            "five golden rings, ", "six geese-a-laying, ", "seven swans-a-swimming, ", "eight maids-a-milking, ", 
            "nine ladies dancing, ", "ten lords-a-leaping, ", "eleven pipers piping, ", "twelve drummers drumming."]

    def get_gift_text(day):
        return "\n".join([f"{gifts[i].capitalize()}{', ' if i < len(gifts)-2 else ''}" for i in range(len(gifts) - day)])

    result = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        result += [f"On the {days[i]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me:\n{get_gift_text(i)}\n"]
    return result
```

Explanation:

- The function `recite` takes two arguments `start_verse` and `end_verse`, which represent the starting and ending verses of the song.
- We define a list called `days` that contains the names of each day of the 12 Days of Christmas.
- We define a list called `gifts` that contains the gifts given on each day of the 12 Days of Christmas.
- We define an inner function called `get_gift_text` that takes one argument `day`. This function returns a string containing all the gifts from the current day until the first day, separated by newlines with appropriate punctuations.
- In this function, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the `gifts` list up to the index corresponding to the current day (`len(gifts) - day`) and capitalize the gift text using the `.capitalize()` method. If it's not the last line, we add a comma at the end except for the last item.
- We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the final output.
- For each verse between `start_verse` and `end_verse`, we append the verse number and the corresponding gift text to the `result` list.
- Finally, we join the lines together with newline characters and return the resulting list. Note that we also added a trailing newline character after each verse to match the expected output format.
