This is known as the Knapsack Problem, and it belongs to the family of optimization problems. We can use dynamic programming to solve it efficiently.\n\n\nWe can define a two-dimensional array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items up to a weight of j. The base cases are when there are no items (dp[0][j] = 0) or the knapsack has zero capacity (dp[i][0] = 0). For each additional item, we have two options: either include it or exclude it. If including it, we check whether its weight is less than or equal to the current capacity j. If it is, we add its value to the maximum value obtained by using the remaining capacity (j - wi) and the previous i-1 items. Otherwise, we keep the same maximum value obtained without considering the new item. We then choose the larger of these two options and update our table accordingly. Finally, the answer will be stored at dp[len(items)][capacity]. Here's the implementation:",
