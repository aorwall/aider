To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal subset of items such that their weights do not exceed the knapsack's capacity while maximizing the total value. This is known as the Knapsack Problem, and it belongs to the family of optimization problems. We can use dynamic programming to solve it efficiently.


We can define a two-dimensional array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items up to a weight of j. The base cases are when there are no items (dp[0][j] = 0) or the knapsack has zero capacity (dp[i][0] = 0). For each additional item, we have two options: either include it or exclude it. If including it, we check whether its weight is less than or equal to the current capacity j. If it is, we add its value to the maximum value obtained by using the remaining capacity (j - wi) and the previous i-1 items. Otherwise, we keep the same maximum value obtained without considering the new item. We then choose the larger of these two options and update our table accordingly. Finally, the answer will be stored at dp[len(items)][capacity]. Here's the implementation:


```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize the dp matrix with zeros
    dp = [[0]*(maximum_weight+1) for _ in range(len(items)+1)]
    
    # Fill the dp matrix iteratively
    for i in range(1, len(items)+1):
        wi, vi = items[i-1]['weight'], items[i-1]['value']
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight+1):
            if j < wi:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-wi]+vi)
    
    # Return the final answer
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight, since we fill out the entire dp matrix once. However, we can optimize it further by using space instead of time. Instead of filling out the whole dp matrix, we can just store the last row and compute the next row based on the previous one. This reduces the memory usage to O(W) but keeps the time complexity the same. Here's the optimized version:


```python
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    prev_row = [0]*(maximum_weight+1)
    curr_row = [0]*(maximum_weight+1)
    
    for i in range(1, len(items)+1):
        wi, vi = items[i-1]['weight'], items[i-1]['value']
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight+1):
            if j >= wi:
                curr_row[j] = max(prev_row[j], prev_row[j-wi]+vi)
        
        prev_row, curr_row = curr_row, prev_row
    
    # Return the final answer
    return prev_row[-1]
```

The idea behind this approach is that we only need to keep track of the previous row and the current row at any point in time. Once we finish computing the current row, we swap them so that the previous row becomes the current row and start over with an empty current row. This way, we avoid creating a large dp matrix and only use constant extra space.
