### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.

Bob is a thief.
After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.

In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).
Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.
However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).

Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.
Note that Bob can take only one of each item.

All values given will be strictly positive.
Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.

For example:

Items: [
  { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },
  { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },
  { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }
]

Knapsack Limit: 10

For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.

In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.
He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.

### Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal subset of items such that their weights do not exceed the knapsack's capacity while maximizing the total value. This is known as the Knapsack Problem, and it belongs to the family of optimization problems. We can use dynamic programming to solve it efficiently.


We can define a two-dimensional array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items up to a weight of j. The base cases are when there are no items (dp[0][j] = 0) or the knapsack has zero capacity (dp[i][0] = 0). For each additional item, we have two options: either include it or exclude it. If including it, we check whether its weight is less than or equal to the current capacity j. If it is, we add its value to the maximum value obtained by using the remaining capacity (j - wi) and the previous i-1 items. Otherwise, we keep the same maximum value obtained without considering the new item. We then choose the larger of these two options and update our table accordingly. Finally, the answer will be stored at dp[len(items)][capacity]. Here's the implementation:
Filepath: knapsack.py
```
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    # Initialize the dp matrix with zeros
    dp = [[0]*(maximum_weight+1) for _ in range(len(items)+1)]

    # Fill the dp matrix iteratively
    for i in range(1, len(items)+1):
        wi, vi = items[i-1]['weight'], items[i-1]['value']
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight+1):
            if j < wi:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-wi]+vi)

    # Return the final answer
    return dp[-1][-1]

```

This solution has a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight, since we fill out the entire dp matrix once. However, we can optimize it further by using space instead of time. Instead of filling out the whole dp matrix, we can just store the last row and compute the next row based on the previous one. This reduces the memory usage to O(W) but keeps the time complexity the same. Here's the optimized version:
Filepath: knapsack.py
```
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    prev_row = [0]*(maximum_weight+1)
    curr_row = [0]*(maximum_weight+1)

    for i in range(1, len(items)+1):
        wi, vi = items[i-1]['weight'], items[i-1]['value']
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight+1):
            if j >= wi:
                curr_row[j] = max(prev_row[j], prev_row[j-wi]+vi)

        prev_row, curr_row = curr_row, prev_row

    # Return the final answer
    return prev_row[-1]

```

The idea behind this approach is that we only need to keep track of the previous row and the current row at any point in time. Once we finish computing the current row, we swap them so that the previous row becomes the current row and start over with an empty current row. This way, we avoid creating a large dp matrix and only use constant extra space.
