The first step is to remove any non-letter characters from the input and convert all letters to lowercase. Then, we split the resulting string into chunks of 5 characters or less (using slicing). We then iterate over these chunks and replace each letter with its corresponding cipher text character based on the `atbash_dict`. Finally, we join the chunks back together with spaces between them to form the final result.\n\n\nThe `decode` function takes a string as input (`ciphered_text`) and performs the inverse operation of encoding. First, we invert the `atbash_dict` so that keys become values and values become keys. This gives us a new dictionary called `decoding_dict`, which can be used to map ciphered characters back to their originals. We split the ciphered text into chunks of 5 characters or less (again using slicing), and then decode each chunk by looking up each character in the `decoding_dict`. Finally, we join the chunks back together without spaces to get the decoded message. Note that this assumes that the input has been encoded using our specific implementation of the Atbash cipher, where chunks are separated by spaces after every 5 characters. If there were no spaces in the input, we would need to modify the code slightly to handle that case.",
