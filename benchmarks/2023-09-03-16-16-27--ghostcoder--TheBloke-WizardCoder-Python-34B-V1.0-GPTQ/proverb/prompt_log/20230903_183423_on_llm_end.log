Here's one possible implementation using the provided code snippet:

```python
def proverb(*items):
    if len(items) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Provide at least two items")
    
    template = "For want of a {} the {} was lost."
    verses = []
    for i in range(len(items)-1):
        verses.append(template.format(items[i], items[i+1]))
    verses.append("And all for the want of a {}.\n".format(items[0]))
    return "\n".join(verses)
```

We can then call it like this:

```python
print(proverb("nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"))
```

Output:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
```

If we want to include the qualifier, we could modify the last line to:

```python
verses.append("{} And all for the want of a {}.\n".format(qualifier, items[0]))
```

Then we can call it like this:

```python
print(proverb("nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom", qualifier="A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"))
```

Output:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
```

Note that we added the `*args` syntax to accept variable number of arguments, which allows us to pass in a list of strings instead of having to specify each item individually. We also used `.format()` method to insert variables into our template string. Finally, we joined the lines together with `\n` separator using the `.join()` method.
