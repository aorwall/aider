When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in\nraise ValueError(\"can't make target with given coins\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: change.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

We initialize the first element (`min_num_coins[0]`) to 0 since we need 0 coins to make 0 cents. Then, we iterate through all the coins and update the table accordingly. For each coin, we check if subtracting its value from the current index would give us a valid solution that uses lesser coins than our previous best solution. If so, we update the `min_num_coins` table. After iterating over all the coins, we check if the last element of the table has a finite value. If it does, then we have found a way to make the target amount using the given coins. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that it's impossible to make the target amount with the given coins.\n\n\nOnce we have calculated the optimal solution, we backtrack to get the actual coins used to make the target amount. We start at the highest denomination coin and keep subtracting it until we reach 0. At each step, we select the coin whose value is just lower than the current amount and add it to the result list. Finally, we reverse the result list to get the correct order of coins.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
