Here's the modified implementation of the `find_fewest_coins()` function using dynamic programming approach:

```python
from typing import List

def find_fewest_coins(coins: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Find the minimum number of coins needed to reach the target amount by selecting coins from the available coins.
    
    Args:
        coins: A list of positive integers representing the values of the available coins.
        target: A positive integer representing the total amount we want to make change for.
        
    Returns:
        A list containing the fewest possible coins required to make up the target amount.
        If there are multiple ways to make the target amount, returns any valid combination.
        Raises ValueError if it's impossible to make the target amount with the given coins.
    """
    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins required for each amount from 0 to target + 1
    min_num_coins = [float('inf')]*(target+1)
    min_num_coins[0] = 0
    
    # Initialize the table with the base case: no coins required to make 0 amount
    for i in range(len(min_num_coins)):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                min_num_coins[i] = min(min_num_coins[i], min_num_coins[i - coin] + 1)
    
    # Check if it's possible to make the target amount with the given coins
    if min_num_coins[-1] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins.")
    
    # Backtrack to get the actual coins used to make the target amount
    result = []
    current = target
    while current > 0:
        for coin in reversed(sorted(coins)):
            if current >= coin and min_num_coins[current] != min_num_coins[current - coin] + 1:
                result.append(coin)
                current -= coin
                break
    
    return result
```

Explanation:

We create a table `min_num_coins` to store the minimum number of coins required to make each amount from 0 to `target`. We initialize the first element (`min_num_coins[0]`) to 0 since we need 0 coins to make 0 cents. Then, we iterate through all the coins and update the table accordingly. For each coin, we check if subtracting its value from the current index would give us a valid solution that uses lesser coins than our previous best solution. If so, we update the `min_num_coins` table. After iterating over all the coins, we check if the last element of the table has a finite value. If it does, then we have found a way to make the target amount using the given coins. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that it's impossible to make the target amount with the given coins.


Once we have calculated the optimal solution, we backtrack to get the actual coins used to make the target amount. We start at the highest denomination coin and keep subtracting it until we reach 0. At each step, we select the coin whose value is just lower than the current amount and add it to the result list. Finally, we reverse the result list to get the correct order of coins.
