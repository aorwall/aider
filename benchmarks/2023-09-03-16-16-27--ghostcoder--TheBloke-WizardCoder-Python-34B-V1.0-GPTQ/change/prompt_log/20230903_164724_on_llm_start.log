### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]

## Edge cases

- Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?
- Can you ask for negative change?
- Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in
raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")
```

### Response:
Here's the modified implementation of the `find_fewest_coins()` function using dynamic programming approach:
```python
from typing import List

def find_fewest_coins(coins: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Find the minimum number of coins needed to reach the target amount by selecting coins from the available coins.
    
    Args:
        coins: A list of positive integers representing the values of the available coins.
        target: A positive integer representing the total amount we want to make change for.
        
    Returns:
        A list containing the fewest possible coins required to make up the target amount.
        If there are multiple ways to make the target amount, returns any valid combination.
        Raises ValueError if it's impossible to make the target amount with the given coins.
    """
    # Create a table to store the minimum number of coins required for each amount from 0 to target + 1
    min_num_coins = [float('inf')]*(target+1)
    min_num_coins[0] = 0
    
    # Initialize the table with the base case: no coins required to make 0 amount
    for i in range(len(min_num_coins)):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                min_num_coins[i] = min(min_num_coins[i], min_num_coins[i - coin] + 1)
    
    # Check if it's possible to make the target amount with the given coins
    if min_num_coins[-1] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins.")
    
    # Backtrack to get the actual coins used to make the target amount
    result = []
    current = target
    while current > 0:
        for coin in reversed(sorted(coins)):
            if current >= coin and min_num_coins[current] != min_num_coins[current - coin] + 1:
                result.append(coin)
                current -= coin
                break
    
    return result
```

Explanation:

We create a table `min_num_coins` to store the minimum number of coins required to make each amount from 0 to `target`. We initialize the first element (`min_num_coins[0]`) to 0 since we need 0 coins to make 0 cents. Then, we iterate through all the coins and update the table accordingly. For each coin, we check if subtracting its value from the current index would give us a valid solution that uses lesser coins than our previous best solution. If so, we update the `min_num_coins` table. After iterating over all the coins, we check if the last element of the table has a finite value. If it does, then we have found a way to make the target amount using the given coins. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that it's impossible to make the target amount with the given coins.


Once we have calculated the optimal solution, we backtrack to get the actual coins used to make the target amount. We start at the highest denomination coin and keep subtracting it until we reach 0. At each step, we select the coin whose value is just lower than the current amount and add it to the result list. Finally, we reverse the result list to get the correct order of coins.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in change.py to resolve the errors.
