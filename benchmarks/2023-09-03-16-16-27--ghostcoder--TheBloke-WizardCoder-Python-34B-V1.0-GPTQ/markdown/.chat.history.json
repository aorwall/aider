It also properly handles empty lines (which should be ignored), and converts bold/italics notation (`**` or `_`) to `<strong>` and `<em>` tags respectively. The regular expression used to match bold/italics uses a non-capturing group `(?P<tag>__|\\*\\*)` to capture the type of formatting (`__` or `**`), then captures the content between them as `\\2`. This allows us to replace only that portion of the string without affecting other parts of the line.",
