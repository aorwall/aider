The implementation looks good! The `DoublyLinkedList` class is well-designed and easy to understand. It includes all the necessary methods for a doubly linked list data structure such as prepend, append, remove, get, insert, and search operations. Additionally, it also has an `__iter__()` method that allows us to iterate over the elements in the list using a for loop. Overall, great job!
