To solve this problem, we can use the Babylonian method of finding square roots. This involves repeatedly taking the average of two guesses until we get closer and closer to the actual square root. Here's how it works:


1. Start with an initial guess of `x` as half of the given number.
2. Calculate the next guess by averaging `x` and the original number divided by `x`.
3. Repeat step 2 until the difference between the new guess and previous guess is less than some small tolerance value.
4. Return the final estimate as the square root.

Here's the implementation:


```python
def square_root(number):
    if number < 0: # negative numbers do not have square roots
        raise ValueError("Number must be non-negative")
    elif number == 0: # edge case where sqrt(0) = 0
        return 0
    
    x = number / 2 # start with an initial guess of half the number
    while True:
        prev_guess = x
        x = (x + number / x) / 2 # calculate the next guess using the average of current guess and number/current guess
        diff = abs(prev_guess - x)
        if diff <= 0.00001: # set a tolerance threshold at 0.0001
            break
    
    return round(x, 4) # round off to four decimal places
```


We first check whether the input number is negative, since negative numbers do not have square roots. If it is zero, we simply return zero. Otherwise, we initialize our initial guess to half of the number and then enter a loop that continues until the difference between the current guess and the previous one is below a certain tolerance level (`0.0001`). We update the guess each time by calculating the average of the current guess and the number divided by the current guess. Finally, we round off the answer to four decimal places before returning it.


Let's test the function with some examples:


```python
print(square_root(9)) # should print 3.0
print(square_root(16)) # should print 4.0
print(square_root(576)) # should print 24.0
print(square_root(81)) # should print 9.0
```

Output:

```
3.0
4.0
24.0
9.0
```

The output matches what we expect!
