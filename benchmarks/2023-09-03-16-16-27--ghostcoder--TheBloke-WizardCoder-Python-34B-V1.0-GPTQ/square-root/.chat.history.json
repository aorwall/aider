This involves repeatedly taking the average of two guesses until we get closer and closer to the actual square root. Here's how it works:\n\n\n1. Start with an initial guess of `x` as half of the given number.\n2. Calculate the next guess by averaging `x` and the original number divided by `x`.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the difference between the new guess and previous guess is less than some small tolerance value.\n4. Return the final estimate as the square root.\n\nHere's the implementation:",
