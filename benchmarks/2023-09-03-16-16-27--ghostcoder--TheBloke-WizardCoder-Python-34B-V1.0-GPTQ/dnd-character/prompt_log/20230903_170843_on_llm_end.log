prompt:
There is no `modifier` function defined in the class `Character`. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to import it from the file `dnd_character.py`, but it doesn't exist. To fix this issue, you need to define the `modifier` function or remove the reference to it from the test file. Here's how you can do it:

In `dnd_character.py`:

```python
def modifier(stat_value):
    """Calculate ability modifier based on stat value."""
    return (stat_value - 10) // 2


class Character:
    # ... rest of your code here
```

And then in `dnd_character_test.py`:

```python
from dnd_character import Character, modifier

# rest of your test cases here
```

This should solve the problem.

Note: Make sure to add the necessary imports and other functions as per the requirements mentioned in the prompt.
