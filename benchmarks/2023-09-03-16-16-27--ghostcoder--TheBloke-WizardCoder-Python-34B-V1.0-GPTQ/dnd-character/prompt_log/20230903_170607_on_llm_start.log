### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.
These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.
You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.
You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.
You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:

- 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
- 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
- 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
- 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
- 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
- 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.

Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

## Notes

Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.
One such language is [Troll][troll].

### Response:
Here's an implementation for the `Character` class that takes care of rolling the required stats using the given rules:
Filepath: dnd_character.py
```
import random
from collections import Counter

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self._stats = {
            'strength': None,
            'dexterity': None,
            'constitution': None,
            'intelligence': None,
            'wisdom': None,
            'charisma': None,
            'hitpoints': None
        }
        
        # Roll 4d6 for each stat and keep the highest three values
        for key in self._stats:
            if key == 'constitution':
                continue
            rolls = sorted([random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)][-3:]
            self._stats[key] = sum(rolls)
        
        # Calculate constitution score by adding up all remaining dice after removing one die with value 1
        remaining_dice = [die for die in range(1, 7) for _ in range(4) if die not in set(rolls)]
        self._stats['constitution'] = sum(sorted(remaining_dice)[-1])
        
        # Calculate hitpoints based on constitution modifier
        con_mod = (-5 if self._stats['constitution'] <= 10 else (0 if 11 <= self._stats['constitution'] <= 12 else 1 if 13 <= self._stats['constitution'] <= 15 else 2 if 16 <= self._stats['constitution'] <= 17 else 3 if 18 <= self._stats['constitution'] <= 19 else 4 if 20 <= self._stats['constitution'] <= 22 else 5)
        self._stats['hitpoints'] = 8 + con_mod
    
    @property
    def strength(self):
        return self._stats['strength']
    
    @property
    def dexterity(self):
        return self._stats['dexterity']
    
    @property
    def constitution(self):
        return self._stats['constitution']
    
    @property
    def intelligence(self):
        return self._stats['intelligence']
    
    @property
    def wisdom(self):
        return self._stats['wisdom']
    
    @property
    def charisma(self):
        return self._stats['charisma']
    
    @property
    def hitpoints(self):
        return self._stats['hitpoints']
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Str: {self.strength}, Dex: {self.dexterity}, Con: {self.constitution}, Int: {self.intelligence}, Wis: {self.wisdom}, Cha: {self.charisma}, HP: {self.hitpoints}"
```

The `__init__()` method initializes a dictionary `_stats` with keys for each statistic (`strength`, `dexterity`, etc.) and sets their values according to the rules provided.
We first roll 4d6 for each stat except `constitution`. We then remove the lowest die from the list of rolled values and add up the remaining ones to get its score. For calculating the `constitution` score, we check what the total number was and apply the corresponding modifier to calculate the hit points.

To access the individual statistics, there are properties defined for each statistic that simply returns the respective value from the `_stats` dictionary.
Finally, we also define a `__repr__()` method to print out the character's attributes when printing it as a string.

You can create a new instance of this class and test it out like so:
```python
c = Character()
print(c)
```

This should output something like:
```
Str: 12, Dex: 14, Con: 10, Int: 16, Wis: 13, Cha: 11, HP: 10
```

Note that since the values are randomly generated, your results might vary depending on how lucky you are!
