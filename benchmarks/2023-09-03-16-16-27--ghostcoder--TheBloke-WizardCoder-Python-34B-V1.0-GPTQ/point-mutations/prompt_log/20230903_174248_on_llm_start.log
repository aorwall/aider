### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or
copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are
vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect
throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very
rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,
the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated
result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.

The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point
mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.

By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands
taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of
the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the
evolutionary path between the two strands.

This is called the 'Hamming distance'

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^

The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

## Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you
may assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming
distance function.

**Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: point_mutations.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's an implementation of the `hamming_distance` function using Python's built-in string operations:
Filepath: point_mutations.py
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("Strands must have same length")

    count = sum([1 for c1, c2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2) if c1 != c2])
    return count

```

We can iterate through both strings simultaneously using the `zip()` function and compare each character pair. If they are different, we increment our counter variable.

To test this function, we can create some sample inputs and expected outputs:
```python
assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'CATCGTAATGACGGCCT') == 7
assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT') == 0
assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', '') == None # Raise error because lengths differ
assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'CAAGCTACTAACGGGT') == 3
```

And here's how we can handle the case where the input strings have different lengths:
Filepath: point_mutations.py
```
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("Strands must have same length")

    count = 0
    for c1, c2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
        if c1 != c2:
            count += 1

    return count

```

In this version, we initialize a counter variable to zero before iterating through the characters in the strings. We then check whether each pair of characters is identical, and if not,
we add 1 to the counter. Finally, we return the total count of mismatched pairs. Note that we do not need to raise an exception since the loop will terminate early if the strings
are of unequal length. However, it might be useful to include a message explaining why the calculation cannot proceed. Here's what the updated test cases would look like:
```python
try:
    assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'CATCGT') == None
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Expected error raised: {e}")
else:
    print("No error was raised.")

assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT') == 0
assert hamming_distance('GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT', 'CAAGCTACTAACGGGT') == 3
```

We wrap the first test in a try-except block so that we can catch the `ValueError` that should be raised when passing invalid input. Otherwise, we expect the function to return `None`, but we also want to make sure that no other exceptions occur.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in point_mutations.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: point_mutations.py
```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
