Here's a corrected version of `hamming_distance` that should pass all the tests:

```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    if len(dna_strand_1) != len(dna_strand_2):
        raise ValueError("Strands must have same length")

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(dna_strand_1)):
        if dna_strand_1[i] != dna_strand_2[i]:
            count += 1

    return count
```

This implementation uses indexing instead of `zip()` to compare each character at position `i` in both strings and increments the counter when they don't match.

Note that this assumes that you want to ignore extra characters in longer sequences. If you want to treat them as mismatches, you can remove the check for equal lengths and use `min()` function to iterate over the shorter sequence only:

```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    count = 0
    for i in range(min(len(dna_strand_1), len(dna_strand_2))):
        if dna_strand_1[i] != dna_strand_2[i]:
            count += 1

    count += abs(len(dna_strand_1) - len(dna_strand_2)) # add difference in length as mismatches

    return count
```

In this case, the first two tests will still fail because they expect an exception to be raised when strands have different lengths. You need to decide which behavior is more appropriate for your program and adjust the tests accordingly.
