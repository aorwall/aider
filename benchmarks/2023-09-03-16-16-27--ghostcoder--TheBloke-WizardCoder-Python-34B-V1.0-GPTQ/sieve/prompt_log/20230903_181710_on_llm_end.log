Here's the implementation for the `primes` function using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:

```python
def primes(limit):
    if limit < 2:
        return []
    
    # Create a boolean array "is_prime[0..n]" and initialize all entries it as true.
    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)
    is_prime[0], is_prime[1] = False, False
    
    # Start with the first prime number, 2.
    p = 2
    while p*p <= limit:
        # If is_prime[p] is True, then mark all its multiples as False.
        if is_prime[p]:
            for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    
    # Return a list of prime numbers.
    return [x for x in range(2, limit+1) if is_prime[x]]
```

Explanation:
- We start by creating a boolean array `is_prime`, where each index represents a number from 0 to `limit`. Initially, we set all values to `True`, indicating that they are prime.
- We skip indices 0 and 1 since they are not prime.
- We iterate over all numbers starting from 2 (the first prime), checking whether they are marked as prime (`if is_prime[p]`).
- For each prime number found, we mark all its multiples as non-prime (`is_prime[i] = False`).
- Finally, we return a list of prime numbers by filtering out the ones that have been marked as non-prime (`return [x for x in range(2, limit+1) if is_prime[x]]`)

Note that this implementation does not use division or modulo operators, which makes it more efficient than other implementations. It also uses a simple loop instead of nested loops, making it easier to read and understand.
