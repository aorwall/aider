### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
# Hints

For the `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception` function, the `filelike_object`
will be an instance of a custom `FileLike` class defined in the test suite. This
class implements the following methods:
- `open` and `close`, for explicit opening and closing.
- `__enter__` and `__exit__`, for implicit opening and closing.
- `do_something`, which may or may not throw an `Exception`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: error_handling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: error_handling.py
```python

```

### Response:
Solution:

We can handle errors using try-except blocks in Python. In case of an exception, we catch it and perform some action like logging the error or returning None.

Here are the updated functions that handle errors and ensure proper resource management:
Filepath: error_handling.py
```
import sys
from typing import Tuple


class FileLike:
    def __init__(self):
        self._is_opened = False

    def open(self):
        self._is_opened = True

    def do_something(self):
        raise Exception("Something went wrong")


    def close(self):
        self._is_opened = False

    @property
    def closed(self):
        return not self._is_opened



def handle_error_by_throwing_exception():
    try:
        1 / 0 # this raises ZeroDivisionError
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print('ZeroDivisionError occurred')
        sys.exit()



def handle_error_by_returning_none(input_data):
    try:
        int('notaninteger')
    except ValueError:
        return None


def handle_error_by_returning_tuple(input_data):
    try:
        int('notaninteger')
    except ValueError:
        return (False, 'Invalid input data')


def filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception(filelike_object):
    try:
        with filelike_object as f:
            f.do_something()
    except Exception:
        pass
    assert filelike_object.closed == True

```

The first function handles errors by throwing an exception and exiting the program. We catch the ZeroDivisionError and log the message before calling sys.exit() to terminate the program.


The second function handles errors by returning None when an invalid input is provided. It tries to convert a string "notaninteger" into an integer but fails because it cannot be converted. Instead of crashing the program, it returns None indicating failure.


The third function also handles errors by returning a tuple containing a boolean flag and an error message. If there is an error during execution, it returns a tuple with False and an appropriate message.


Finally, the fourth function uses context manager to manage the lifecycle of the file object. When an exception occurs while working with the file object, it ensures that it gets properly closed using the `__exit__()` method of the `with` statement. The `assert` statement checks whether the file has been closed after the exception is caught.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in error_handling.py to resolve the errors.

```python
