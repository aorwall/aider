### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:

```text
  a b c d e f g h
8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 8
7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7
6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 6
5 _ _ W _ _ _ _ _ 5
4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 4
3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 3
2 _ _ _ _ _ B _ _ 2
1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1
  a b c d e f g h
```

You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" `ValueErrors` if the `Queen` constructor is passed numbers that are negative, or numbers that are not a valid row or column.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it. You also should `raise` a `ValueError` if both the queens passed to the `can_attack()` method are on the same location.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the row parameter is negative
raise ValueError("row not positive")

# if the row parameter is not on the defined board
raise ValueError("row not on board")

# if the column parameter is negative
raise ValueError("column not positive")

# if the column parameter is not on the defined board
raise ValueError("column not on board")

# if both the queens are on the same location
raise ValueError("Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: queen_attack.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's the modified implementation for the `Queen` class:
Filepath: queen_attack.py
```
class Queen:
    def __init__(self, row, column):
        self.row = row
        self.col = column

        # Check if row and col are non-negative integers
        if not (isinstance(row, int) and isinstance(column, int)):
            raise ValueError("Row and Column must be integers.")
        elif row < 0 or column < 0:
            raise ValueError("Row and Column cannot be negative.")
        elif not (1 <= row <= 8 and 1 <= column <= 8):
            raise ValueError("Row and Column must be between 1 and 8 inclusive.")


    def can_attack(self, another_queen):
        if self.row == another_queen.row and self.col == another_queen.col:
            raise ValueError("Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square")
        return (self.row == another_queen.row or self.col == another_queen.col or abs(self.row - another_queen.row) == abs(self.col - another_queen.col))

```

In the `__init__` method, we check whether the input parameters are integers and within the range of 1 to 8. If either condition fails, we raise a `ValueError`. We then store them as instance variables.

The `can_attack` method checks if two queens are on the same square by comparing their positions directly. If so, we raise a `ValueError`, otherwise we calculate if they can attack each other using the given conditions.

Note that we assume that the chessboard has dimensions 8x8. If you want to make it generic, you could add a size parameter to the class and update the conditions accordingly.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in queen_attack.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: queen_attack.py
```python
class Queen:
    def __init__(self, row, column):
        self.row = row
        self.col = column

        # Check if row and col are non-negative integers
        if not (isinstance(row, int) and isinstance(column, int)):
            raise ValueError("Row and Column must be integers.")
        elif row < 0 or column < 0:
            raise ValueError("Row and Column cannot be negative.")
        elif not (1 <= row <= 8 and 1 <= column <= 8):
            raise ValueError("Row and Column must be between 1 and 8 inclusive.")


    def can_attack(self, another_queen):
        if self.row == another_queen.row and self.col == another_queen.col:
