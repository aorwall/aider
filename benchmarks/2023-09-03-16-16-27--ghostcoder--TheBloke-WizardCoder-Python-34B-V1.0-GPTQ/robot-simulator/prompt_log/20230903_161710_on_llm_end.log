Solution:

We can define the globals for the directions as follows:

```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'
```

Then, we need to update the `Robot` class to keep track of its current position and direction.

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos
```

Next, we need to add methods to move the robot based on its current position and direction, and rotate it according to the input instruction.

```python
class Robot:
    # ... previous code ...
    
    def move(self, instruction):
        if instruction == 'R':
            self.rotate('right')
        elif instruction == 'L':
            self.rotate('left')
        else:
            self.advance()
    
    def rotate(self, direction='right'):
        if direction == 'right':
            if self.direction == NORTH:
                self.direction = EAST
            elif self.direction == EAST:
                self.direction = SOUTH
            elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                self.direction = WEST
            else:
                self.direction = NORTH
        else:
            if self.direction == NORTH:
                self.direction = WEST
            elif self.direction == WEST:
                self.direction = SOUTH
            elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                self.direction = EAST
            else:
                self.direction = NORTH
    
    def advance(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.y_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.x_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.y_pos -= 1
        else:
            self.x_pos -= 1
```

Finally, we can
