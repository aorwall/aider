### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.
  Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python

```

### Response:
Solution:

We can define the globals for the directions as follows:
Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        pass

```

Then, we need to update the `Robot` class to keep track of its current position and direction.
Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

```

Next, we need to add methods to move the robot based on its current position and direction, and rotate it according to the input instruction.
Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'east'
NORTH = 'north'
WEST = 'west'
SOUTH = 'south'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def move(self, instruction):
        if instruction == 'R':
            self.rotate('right')
        elif instruction == 'L':
            self.rotate('left')
        else:
            self.advance()

    def rotate(self, direction='right'):
        if direction == 'right':
            if self.direction == NORTH:
                self.direction = EAST
            elif self.direction == EAST:
                self.direction = SOUTH
            elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                self.direction = WEST
            else:
                self.direction = NORTH
        else:
            if self.direction == NORTH:
                self.direction = WEST
            elif self.direction == WEST:
                self.direction = SOUTH
            elif self.direction == SOUTH:
                self.direction = EAST
            else:
                self.direction = NORTH

    def advance(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.y_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.x_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.y_pos -= 1
        else:
            self.x_pos -= 1

```

Finally, we can
