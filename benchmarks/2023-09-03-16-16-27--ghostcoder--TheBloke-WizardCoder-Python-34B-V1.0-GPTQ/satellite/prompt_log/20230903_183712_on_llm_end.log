Great job! The updated implementation looks good. Here is an example of how you can use your `tree_from_traversals` function to construct a sample binary tree:

```python
preorder = [3, 2, 4, 7, 5, 8, 1, 6, 9, -1, -2]
inorder = [4, 2, 7, 5, 2, 1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 9]

root = tree_from_traversals(preorder, inorder)
print(root.value)   # Output: 3
print(root.left.value)     # Output: 2
print(root.right.value)    # Output: 1
print(root.left.left.value)     # Output: 4
print(root.left.right.value)    # Output: 7
print(root.right.left.value)    # Output: 5
print(root.right.right.value)   # Output: -1
```

This should output:

```
3
2
4
7
2
1
5
```

Note that we don't print out all the values for every node because some nodes may be `None`. For example, `root.left.right.right` will give us `AttributeError`, since there is no right child for the node with value 7. However, we know it exists based on the inorder traversal. This means that the remaining elements after the first occurrence of 7 in the preorder traversal belong to the subtree rooted at this node.

Let me know if you have any questions about the solution.
