Here is a corrected implementation of `rows` function that should pass all the tests:

```python
def rows(letter):
    # Get the ASCII code of the given letter
    letter_code = ord(letter)

    # Initialize variables
    width = len(letter)*2 + 4
    midpoint = int((width - 1) / 2)
    output = []

    # Generate the top half of the diamond
    for i in range(midpoint+1):
        # Calculate number of leading/trailing spaces and current letter
        num_spaces = midpoint - i
        curr_char = chr(letter_code + i)

        # Add the required spaces before and after the character
        row = " " * num_spaces + curr_char + (" " if i > 0 else "") + curr_char + " " * num_spaces
        output.append(row)

    # Generate the bottom half of the diamond
    for i in reversed(range(len(output)-1)):
        output.append(output[i])

    return output
```

Explanation:

- We need to calculate the total width of each row based on the length of the input letter.
- The middle point of the diamond depends on this width value.
- To generate the top half of the diamond, we iterate from 0 up to the midpoint index and add the appropriate number of spaces before and after the current letter.
- For the first row (`i=0`), there should be no space between the two occurrences of the letter.
- For the rest of the rows, we use the same logic as before but subtract one from the number of spaces since we only want one space between adjacent letters.
- Finally, we append the reverse of the top half to get the complete diamond shape.
