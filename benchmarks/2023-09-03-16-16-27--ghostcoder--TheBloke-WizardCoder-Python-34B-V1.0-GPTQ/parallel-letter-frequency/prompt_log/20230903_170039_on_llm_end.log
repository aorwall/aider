To count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation, we need to split the input text into smaller chunks so that multiple threads can work on them simultaneously. We can use Python's built-in `threading` module to create multiple threads and divide the task among them. Each thread will compute the frequency of letters in its chunk of the text and combine their results at the end. Here's how we can do this:


First, let's define a helper function to count the frequency of letters in a single chunk of text.

```python
import string
from collections import Counter

def count_letters(chunk):
    """ Count the frequency of letters in a chunk of text """
    freq = Counter()
    for char in chunk:
        if char in string.ascii_lowercase:
            freq[char] += 1
    return freq
```

Now, we can use this function to count the frequency of letters in a larger text by dividing it into smaller chunks and processing each chunk in a separate thread.

```python
import threading

class FrequencyCounter():
    def __init__(self, num_threads=4):
        self._num_threads = num_threads
        
    def _split_chunks(self, text, size):
        """ Split text into equal sized chunks """
        chunks = []
        for i in range(0, len(text), size):
            chunks.append(text[i:i+size])
        return chunks
    
    def _process_chunk(self, chunk, freq):
        """ Process a chunk of text and update shared dictionary """
        freq.update(count_letters(chunk))
        
    def calculate(self, text):
        # Divide text into chunks based on number of threads
        chunks = self._split_chunks(text, int(len(text) / self._num_threads))
        
        # Create a shared dictionary to store frequencies across threads
        freq = {}
        lock = threading.Lock()  # To ensure atomic updates to the shared dict
        
        # Start worker threads
        threads = [threading.Thread(target=self._process_chunk,
                                args=(chunk, freq)
                                ) for chunk in chunks]
        for t in threads:
            t.start()
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
            
        # Combine the counts from different threads
        combined_freq = sum([Counter(v) for v in freq.values()], Counter())
        return combined_freq
```

We first split the input text into smaller chunks based on the number of threads specified (default is 4). Then, we start one thread per chunk and process each chunk concurrently using the `_process_chunk()` method which calls the `count_letters()` function defined earlier. Finally, we combine the results from all threads using the `sum()` function and return the combined frequency counter object.


Here's the complete implementation:

```python
import string
from collections import Counter
import threading

class FrequencyCounter():
    def __init__(self, num_threads=4):
        self._num_threads = num_threads
        
    def _split_chunks(self, text, size):
        """ Split text into equal sized chunks """
        chunks = []
        for i in range(0, len(text), size):
            chunks.append(text[i:i+size])
        return chunks
    
    def _process_chunk(self, chunk, freq):
        """ Process a chunk of text and update shared
