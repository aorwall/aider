Here's one possible implementation for the `Garden` class that meets all requirements:

```python
class Garden:
    # Define the mapping between plants and their names.
    PLANT_NAMES = {
        'V': 'Violets',
        'R': 'Radishes',
        'C': 'Clover',
        'G': 'Grass',
        'T': 'Tulips'
    }

    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        self.diagram = diagram.strip().split('\n')
        if len(self.diagram) != 4:
            raise ValueError('Diagram must have exactly four rows.')
        if len(self.diagram[0]) % 2 == 1:
            raise ValueError('Each row of the diagram must have an even number of characters.')
        
        if students is None:
            # Use the default list of students.
            self.students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Ginny', 'Harriet', 'Ileana', 'John', 'Kincaid', 'Larry']
        else:
            # Check that there are enough students for each plot.
            num_plots = (len(self.diagram[0]) // 2) * len(self.diagram)
            if len(students) < num_plots:
                raise ValueError('Not enough students for all plots.')
            self.students = sorted(students[:num_plots])

        self._build_plot_map()

    
    def _build_plot_map(self):
        """Build a dictionary mapping student name to plant type."""
        self.plant_map = {}
        for i, row in enumerate(self.diagram):
            for j in range(0, len(row), 2):
                student = self.students[(i*6 + j//2) % len(self.students)]
                plant = self.PLANT_NAMES[row[j]]
                self.plant_map[student] = plant

    
    def plants(self, student_name):
        return self.plant_map[student_name]
```

The `__init__()` method takes two arguments: `diagram`, which represents the garden layout, and `students`, which is an optional list of up to six strings representing the names of the students. If no `students` list is given, it defaults to the original 12 students from the problem statement. The method first checks that the input is valid by ensuring that the diagram has exactly four rows and each row has an even length. It then initializes the `self.students` attribute with either the full list or a subset of the given list, depending on how many plots are available. Finally, it calls `_build_plot_map()`, which creates a dictionary mapping each student name to its corresponding plant type based on the diagram.

The `_build_plot_map()` method iterates over each character in the diagram and assigns the appropriate plant to each student using modular arithmetic to cycle through the students list. Note that we assume that the students are ordered alphabetically; if this isn't true, we can sort them before creating the map.

The `plants()` method simply returns the value associated with the given student name in the `self.plant_map` dictionary. We could also add error checking here to ensure that the student name exists in the map before returning the plant type.
