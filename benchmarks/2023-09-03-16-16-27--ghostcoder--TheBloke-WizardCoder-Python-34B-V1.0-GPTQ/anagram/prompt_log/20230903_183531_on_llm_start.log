### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.
A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.

Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.

The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).
Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.
The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).
Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.

Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: anagram.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's the modified code for finding anagrams using Python's built-in Counter module:
```python
from collections import Counter

def find_anagrams(target, candidates):
    """
    Given a target string and a list of strings, returns all the anagrams of the target found in the list.
    Anagrams are defined as words that contain the same letters in different orders.
    Case sensitive.
    
    Args:
      target: A string representing the target word.
      candidates: A list of strings representing potential anagrams.
    Returns:
      A list of strings containing all the anagrams of the target found in the candidates.
    """
    # Convert the target into a dictionary of character counts
    target_counts = Counter(target)
    # Initialize an empty list to store the anagrams
    anagrams = []
    # Iterate over the candidates
    for candidate in candidates:
        if len(candidate) == len(target):
            # Check if the candidate has the same count of characters as the target
            if Counter(candidate) == target_counts:
                anagrams.append(candidate)
    return anagrams
```

We can use the `Counter()` method from the `collections` module to convert both the target and candidate strings into dictionaries where keys represent unique characters and values represent their respective frequencies. If two strings have the same frequency distribution, they are considered anagrams. We compare the frequency distributions of the target and candidate strings using the `==` operator. This approach works because dictionaries are unordered, so even though the order of characters may differ between the two strings, their frequency distributions will match if they are anagrams.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in anagram.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: anagram.py
```python
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    pass

```
