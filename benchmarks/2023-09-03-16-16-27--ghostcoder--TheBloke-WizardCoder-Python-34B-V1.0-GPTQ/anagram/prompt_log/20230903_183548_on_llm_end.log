Here's a possible solution for `find_anagrams` that should fix the issues you encountered:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    word_lower = word.lower()
    word_sorted = sorted(word_lower)
    result = []
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        if len(candidate) == len(word):
            candidate_lower = candidate.lower()
            if word_sorted == sorted(candidate_lower):
                result.append(candidate)
    return result
```

This implementation converts both the input word and each candidate to lower case using `.lower()` before comparing them. It also uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the letters of each string so that we can compare their letter counts without regard to order.


We initialize an empty list called `result`, then iterate over all the candidates. If the length of the candidate matches the length of the input word, we convert it to lower case as well and check whether its sorted version equals the sorted input word. If they match, we add it to our result list. Finally, we return the result list containing any matching candidates. Note that this implementation assumes that the input `candidates` is a list or tuple of strings. If it could be something else, such as a set or dictionary, we would need to modify how we iterate over it accordingly.
