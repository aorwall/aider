Here's the modified code for finding anagrams using Python's built-in Counter module:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_anagrams(target, candidates):
    """
    Given a target string and a list of strings, returns all the anagrams of the target found in the list.
    Anagrams are defined as words that contain the same letters in different orders.
    Case sensitive.
    
    Args:
      target: A string representing the target word.
      candidates: A list of strings representing potential anagrams.
    Returns:
      A list of strings containing all the anagrams of the target found in the candidates.
    """
    # Convert the target into a dictionary of character counts
    target_counts = Counter(target)
    # Initialize an empty list to store the anagrams
    anagrams = []
    # Iterate over the candidates
    for candidate in candidates:
        if len(candidate) == len(target):
            # Check if the candidate has the same count of characters as the target
            if Counter(candidate) == target_counts:
                anagrams.append(candidate)
    return anagrams
```

We can use the `Counter()` method from the `collections` module to convert both the target and candidate strings into dictionaries where keys represent unique characters and values represent their respective frequencies. If two strings have the same frequency distribution, they are considered anagrams. We compare the frequency distributions of the target and candidate strings using the `==` operator. This approach works because dictionaries are unordered, so even though the order of characters may differ between the two strings, their frequency distributions will match if they are anagrams.
