        "text": "# Instructions\n\nGiven two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.\n\nThere are some rules that your solution must follow:\n\n- You can only do one action at a time.\n- There are only 3 possible actions:\n  1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:\n     a) the first bucket is empty\n     b) the second bucket is full\n  2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\n  3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\n- After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\n\nYour program will take as input:\n\n- the size of bucket one\n- the size of bucket two\n- the desired number of liters to reach\n- which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two\n\nYour program should determine:\n\n- the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket\n- which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two\n- how many liters are left in the other bucket\n\nNote: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.\n\nExample:\nBucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.\nLet's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).\nIf you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.\nInstead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.\n\nAnother Example:\nBucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.\nYou are told you must start with bucket one.\nSo your first action is to fill bucket one.\nYou choose to empty bucket one for your second action.\nFor your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\n\nWritten with <3 at [Fullstack Academy][fullstack] by Lindsay Levine.\n\n[fullstack]: https://www.fullstackacademy.com/\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\nraise ValueError(\"A meaningful error message here.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two_bucket.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

We also create another variable called `other_bucket` with the value of the larger bucket.\nThen we enter an infinite loop where we keep filling up one of the buckets until it reaches or exceeds the goal amount. If it does, we return the number of steps taken (`steps`) along with the name of the bucket that contains the goal amount and the remaining amount in the other bucket.\nIf the sum of both buckets is less than the goal, we fill up the empty bucket from the fuller one. Otherwise, we pour out some water from the fuller bucket into the emptier one until it becomes equal to the goal amount.\nAt each step, we swap the names of the buckets so that the next iteration starts with the filled bucket.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input values are positive integers. It can be modified to handle negative inputs by adding appropriate checks and conditions.",
