It then checks whether the most significant bit is set to reverse the order of the operations, removes it, and iterates over the remaining bits to append their corresponding actions to the result list. If a bit has value greater than zero, it appends the action that many times to the result list. Finally, it returns the resulting list of actions. Note that the order of the actions may need to be reversed depending on the presence of the most significant bit. Here's an explanation of the steps:\n\n\n1. Define a dictionary mapping each positional bit to its corresponding action.\n2. Check if the most significant bit is set by looking at the last element of the input binary string (`bits[-1]`). If it is set, reverse the order of the bits using slicing notation (`bits[::-1]`).\n3. Delete the most significant bit from the list of bits (`del bits[-1]`).\n4. Iterate over the remaining bits (`for i, bit in enumerate(bits)`) and append the corresponding action to the result list if the bit is nonzero (`if bit != 0`). Use the `* bit` syntax to repeat the action multiple times if necessary.\n5. Return the result list of actions.\n\nYou can test the function with some examples:",

If there's no key for a specific power of two, we skip it. This prevents the KeyError caused by trying to access non-existent keys like `'6'`. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
