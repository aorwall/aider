### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.

When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.

Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.
Now we must sort the entire array again!
We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.
But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.

Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.

A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.
Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.
The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.
Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.
All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.

For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:

      4
     /
    2

If we then added 6, it would look like this:

      4
     / \
    2   6

If we then added 3, it would look like this

       4
     /   \
    2     6
     \
      3

And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this

          4
        /   \
       /     \
      2       6
     / \     / \
    1   3   5   7

### Response:
Here's an implementation for the `BinarySearchTree` class with the required methods:
Filepath: binary_search_tree.py
```
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return f'TreeNode(data={self.data}, left={self.left}, right={self.right})'


class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self, tree_data):
        self.root = None
        for num in tree_data:
            self.add(num)


    def add(self, data):
        """Adds a new element to the BST"""
        if not self.root:
            self.root = TreeNode(data)
        else:
            curr = self.root
            while True:
                if data < curr.data:
                    if not curr.left:
                        curr.left = TreeNode(data)
                        break
                    else:
                        curr = curr.left
                elif data > curr.data:
                    if not curr.right:
                        curr.right = TreeNode(data)
                        break
                    else:
                        curr = curr.right


    def _sorted_data(self, node, result):
        """Helper method to get the sorted data recursively"""
        if node:
            self._sorted_data(node.left, result)
            result.append(node.data)
            self._sorted_data(node.right, result)


    @property
    def data(self):
        """Returns the root node of the BST"""
        return self.root


    def sorted_data(self):
        """Returns the sorted list of data in the BST"""
        result = []
        self._sorted_data(self.root, result)
        return result

```

Explanation:
- The `__init__()` method takes a list of integers as input and initializes the BST using those values.
- The `add()` method adds a new value to the BST by traversing through the tree until finding the correct position based on whether the value is smaller or larger than the current node's data. If there is no left or right child, it creates a new node and sets it accordingly.
- `_sorted_data()` is a helper method used by `sorted_data()`. It appends the data of each node to a list in order by recursively traversing the left and right subtrees.
- `data` property returns the root node of the BST.
- `sorted_data()` method uses the helper method to traverse the entire tree and append the data of each node to a list, which is returned after sorting.

Note: This implementation assumes that duplicates are allowed in the BST. If you want to disallow duplicates, you should check for equality before adding a new node.
