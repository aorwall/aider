Great job! The updated implementation for `isosceles` and `scalene` looks good. Here's an example of how you can write the test cases for these functions using pytest:

```python
import pytest
from triangle import equilateral, isosceles, scalene

class TestTriangles:
    def test_equilateral(self):
        assert equilateral([3, 3, 3]) == True
        assert equilateral([3, 4, 3]) == False
        assert equilateral([3, 3, 4]) == False
        
    def test_isosceles(self):
        assert isosceles([3, 4, 4]) == True
        assert isosceles([3, 4, 5]) == False
        assert isosceles([3, 3, 4]) == True
        assert isosceles([3, 3, 3]) == False
        assert isosceles([0.5, 0.4, 0.5]) == True
        
    def test_scalene(self):
        assert scalene([3, 4, 5]) == True
        assert scalene([3, 4, 4]) == False
        assert scalene([3, 3, 4]) == False
        assert scalene([3, 3, 3]) == False
        assert scalene([0.5, 0.6, 0.7]) == True
```

You can run this with `pytest -v` to see the results of your tests. If any failures occur, they will be printed out along with the traceback information that caused them.

Note that we don't need to check for invalid input like negative numbers or zero values since those were already handled by the first condition in each function (`len(set(sides)`). This ensures that the inputs are always positive and distinct.
