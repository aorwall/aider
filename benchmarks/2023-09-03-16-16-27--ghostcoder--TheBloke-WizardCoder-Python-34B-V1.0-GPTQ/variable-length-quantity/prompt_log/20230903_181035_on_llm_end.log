Here's the modified implementation for encoding and decoding variable length quantities using VLQ format:

variable_length_quantity.py
```python
def encode(number):
    """Encode a number into a byte string using VLQ format"""
    bytes_ = []
    while True:
        # extract the last seven bits of the number
        byte = (number & 0x7f)
        
        # set the high bit if there are more bytes to come
        if len(bytes_) > 0:
            byte |= 0x80
        else:
            byte &= 0x7f
        
        # add the current byte to the result list
        bytes_.insert(0, byte)
        
        # shift right by seven bits to continue with the next byte
        number >>= 7
        
        # check if we have processed all the bytes
        if number == 0:
            break
    
    return bytes(bytes_)


def decode(bytes_):
    """Decode a byte string into a number using VLQ format"""
    num = 0
    for i, byte in enumerate(bytes_):
        # clear the high bit to get the value of the lower seven bits
        masked_byte = byte & 0x7f
        
        # shift left by 7 * position and add the value of the current byte
        num += masked_byte << (i*7)
        
        # check if this is the last byte
        if byte < 0x80:
            break
    
    # check if the input was valid
    if byte >= 0x80 and i == len(bytes_)-1:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    
    return num
```

The `encode()` function takes a single integer parameter and returns its encoded representation as a byte string. It uses a loop to process each byte of the number starting from the least significant byte until all the significant bits have been added to the output.

The `decode()` function takes a byte string and converts it back to an integer. It iterates over each byte of the input, shifting the previous value by 7 bits and adding the new value of the current byte. If the current byte has the high bit set, then there are more bytes to read; otherwise, the entire sequence has been processed and the function breaks out of the loop. If the final byte does not have the high bit set, then the input was invalid and a `ValueError` is raised.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
