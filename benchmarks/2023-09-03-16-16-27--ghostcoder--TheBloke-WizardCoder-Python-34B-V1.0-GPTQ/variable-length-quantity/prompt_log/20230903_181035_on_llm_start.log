### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.

The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.

In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.
Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).
So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.
Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.
To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.
In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.

So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.
Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.
Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:

```text
 NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY
00000000              00
00000040              40
0000007F              7F
00000080             81 00
00002000             C0 00
00003FFF             FF 7F
00004000           81 80 00
00100000           C0 80 00
001FFFFF           FF FF 7F
00200000          81 80 80 00
08000000          C0 80 80 00
0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the sequence is incomplete
raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's the modified implementation for encoding and decoding variable length quantities using VLQ format:

variable_length_quantity.py
Filepath: variable_length_quantity.py
```
def encode(number):
    """Encode a number into a byte string using VLQ format"""
    bytes_ = []
    while True:
        # extract the last seven bits of the number
        byte = (number & 0x7f)

        # set the high bit if there are more bytes to come
        if len(bytes_) > 0:
            byte |= 0x80
        else:
            byte &= 0x7f

        # add the current byte to the result list
        bytes_.insert(0, byte)

        # shift right by seven bits to continue with the next byte
        number >>= 7

        # check if we have processed all the bytes
        if number == 0:
            break

    return bytes(bytes_)
def encode(numbers):
    pass


def decode(bytes_):
    """Decode a byte string into a number using VLQ format"""
    num = 0
    for i, byte in enumerate(bytes_):
        # clear the high bit to get the value of the lower seven bits
        masked_byte = byte & 0x7f

        # shift left by 7 * position and add the value of the current byte
        num += masked_byte << (i*7)

        # check if this is the last byte
        if byte < 0x80:
            break

    # check if the input was valid
    if byte >= 0x80 and i == len(bytes_)-1:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")

    return num

```

The `encode()` function takes a single integer parameter and returns its encoded representation as a byte string. It uses a loop to process each byte of the number starting from the least significant byte until all the significant bits have been added to the output.

The `decode()` function takes a byte string and converts it back to an integer. It iterates over each byte of the input, shifting the previous value by 7 bits and adding the new value of the current byte. If the current byte has the high bit set, then there are more bytes to read; otherwise, the entire sequence has been processed and the function breaks out of the loop. If the final byte does not have the high bit set, then the input was invalid and a `ValueError` is raised.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
