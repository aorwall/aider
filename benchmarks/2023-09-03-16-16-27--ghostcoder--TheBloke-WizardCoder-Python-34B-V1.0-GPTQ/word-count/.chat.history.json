DO YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe ordering of the word counts in the results doesn't matter.\n\nHere's an example that incorporates several of the elements discussed above:\n\n- simple words\n- contractions\n- numbers\n- case insensitive words\n- punctuation (including apostrophes) to separate words\n- different forms of whitespace to separate words\n\n`\"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!\", cried the Special Agent.\\nSo I fled.`\n\nThe mapping for this subtitle would be:\n\n```text\n123: 1\nagent: 1\ncried: 1\nfled: 1\ni: 1\npassword: 2\nso: 1\nspecial: 1\nthat's: 1\nthe: 2\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_count.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
