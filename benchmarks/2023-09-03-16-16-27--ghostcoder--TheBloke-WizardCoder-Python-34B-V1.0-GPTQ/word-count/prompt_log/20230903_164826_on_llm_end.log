Great job! The updated `count_words` function should work as expected now. Here is a possible solution for the problem with apostrophes:

```python
import re
from collections import Counter

def count_words(sentence):
    # Remove all non-alphanumeric characters except apostrophes and convert to lowercase
    cleaned = re.sub("[^a-zA-Z0-9'\s]+", '', sentence).replace("'", "").lower()

    # Split the string into words
    words = cleaned.split()

    # Count the frequency of each word
    return dict(Counter(words))
```

This will remove any character that is not alphanumeric or whitespace, including punctuations, but keep apostrophes. Then we replace them with an empty space before converting to lowercase.

Let me know if you have any questions about this implementation.
