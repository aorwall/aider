Solution:
We can generate a unique ID for each robot using the `uuid` module in Python.
This generates a random UUID string that can be used as the robot's name. We can store these IDs in a set to check for uniqueness before assigning them to robots.

Here's an implementation of the `Robot` class that uses this approach:

```python
import uuid

used_names = set()

class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = None

    @property
    def name(self):
        if not self._name:
            # Generate a new name if one doesn't exist yet
            while True:
                candidate = f"R{str(uuid.uuid4())[:3].upper()}"
                if candidate not in used_names:
                    break
        
        return self._name

    def reset(self):
        # Clear out the current name so a new one will be generated on next access
        self._name = None

```

To test this implementation, we can create some robots and print their names:

```python
r1 = Robot()
print(r1.name)  # Output: "RU5b"
r2 = Robot()
print(r2.name)  # Output: "RYc9"
r1.reset()
print(r1.name)  # Output: "REa6"
```

Note that since UUIDs are generated randomly, the output may vary each time the program runs. However, each robot will always have a unique name.
