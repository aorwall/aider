Here's the modified version of the `say()` function that handles numbers within the specified range (0 - 999,999,999,999) and raises a `ValueError` for out of range inputs:

```python
def say(number):
    # Define the dictionary mapping for single digits
    ones = {
        0: "",
        1: "one",
        2: "two",
        3: "three",
        4: "four",
        5: "five",
        6: "six",
        7: "seven",
        8: "eight",
        9: "nine"
    }

    # Define the dictionary mapping for double digits
    tens = {
        10: "ten",
        11: "eleven",
        12: "twelve",
        13: "thirteen",
        14: "fourteen",
        15: "fifteen",
        16: "sixteen",
        17: "seventeen",
        18: "eighteen",
        19: "nineteen"
    }

    # Define the dictionary mapping for tens
    tens_multiples = {
        2: "twenty",
        3: "thirty",
        4: "forty",
        5: "fifty",
        6: "sixty",
        7: "seventy",
        8: "eighty",
        9: "ninety"
    }

    # Define the dictionary mapping for thousands
    thousands = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]

    def num_to_words(num):
        """Converts a number less than 10000 into words"""
        if num == 0:
            return ""
        elif num < 10:
            return ones[num] + " "
        elif num < 20:
            return tens[num] + " "
        elif num < 100:
            return tens[(num // 10)] + " " + ones[num % 10] + " "
        else:
            return ones[(num // 100)] + " hundred " + num_to_words(num % 100)

    
    # Check if the input is out of range
    if number < 0 or number > 99999999999:
        raise ValueError("Input out of range")


    # Convert the number to string and split by groups of 3 digits
    num_str = str(number)
    num_groups = [int(num_str[i:i+3]) for i in range(0, len(num_str), 3)]

    # Initialize the result list
    result = []

    # Iterate over each group of digits starting from the least significant digit
    for i, group in enumerate(reversed(num_groups):
        # If the current group has leading zeros, skip it
        if group == 0:
            continue
        # Get the corresponding word for the group and add it to the result list
        result.append(num_to_words(group))
        # Add the name of the scale (thousands, millions, billions) if needed
        if i != 0 and group != 0:
            result.append(thousands[len(num_groups)-i-1])

    # Join the words using spaces and return the final result
    return ' '.join(result[: : :-1]).strip()
```

We first define dictionaries for converting single digits, double digits, and multiples of ten. Then we define a helper function `num_to_words()` which converts a number up to 999 into its word representation.

Next, we check if the input is out of range and raise a `ValueError` if it is. We convert the input integer to a string and split it into groups of 3 digits, then iterate over them from right to left (least significant to most significant) while adding their word representations to the result list. Finally, we join the words using spaces and return the resulting string after stripping extra whitespace.


Note that we reverse the order of the groups before joining them because we want to start with the smallest scale (hundreds) and work our way up to the largest (trillions). Also note that we strip extra whitespace at the end of the resulting string to remove any trailing space characters.
