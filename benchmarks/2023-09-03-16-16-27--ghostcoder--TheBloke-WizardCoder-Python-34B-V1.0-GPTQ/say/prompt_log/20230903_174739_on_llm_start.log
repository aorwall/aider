### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Given a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999, spell out that number in English.

## Step 1

Handle the basic case of 0 through 99.

If the input to the program is `22`, then the output should be `'twenty-two'`.

Your program should complain loudly if given a number outside the blessed range.

Some good test cases for this program are:

- 0
- 14
- 50
- 98
- -1
- 100

### Extension

If you're on a Mac, shell out to Mac OS X's `say` program to talk out loud.
If you're on Linux or Windows, eSpeakNG may be available with the command `espeak`.

## Step 2

Implement breaking a number up into chunks of thousands.

So `1234567890` should yield a list like 1, 234, 567, and 890, while the far simpler `1000` should yield just 1 and 0.

The program must also report any values that are out of range.

## Step 3

Now handle inserting the appropriate scale word between those chunks.

So `1234567890` should yield `'1 billion 234 million 567 thousand 890'`

The program must also report any values that are out of range.
It's fine to stop at "trillion".

## Step 4

Put it all together to get nothing but plain English.

`12345` should give `twelve thousand three hundred forty-five`.

The program must also report any values that are out of range.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the number input to `say()` is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the number is negative
raise ValueError("input out of range")

# if the number is larger than 999,999,999,999
raise ValueError("input out of range")
```

### Response:
Here's the modified version of the `say()` function that handles numbers within the specified range (0 - 999,999,999,999) and raises a `ValueError` for out of range inputs:
Filepath: say.py
```
def say(number):
    # Define the dictionary mapping for single digits
    ones = {
        0: "",
        1: "one",
        2: "two",
        3: "three",

    tens = {
        10: "ten",
        11: "eleven",
        12: "twelve",
        13: "thirteen",
        14: "fourteen",
        15: "fifteen",
        16: "sixteen",
        17: "seventeen",

    }

    tens_multiples = {

        7: "seventy",
        8: "eighty",
        9: "ninety"
    }

    # Define the dictionary mapping for thousands
    thousands = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]

    def num_to_words(num):
        """Converts a number less than 10000 into words"""
        if num == 0:
            return ""
        elif num < 10:
            return ones[num] + " "
        elif num < 20:
            return tens[num] + " "
        elif num < 100:
            return tens[(num // 10)] + " " + ones[num % 10] + " "
        else:
            return ones[(num // 100)] + " hundred " + num_to_words(num % 100)


    # Check if the input is out of range
    if number < 0 or number > 99999999999:
        raise ValueError("Input out of range")


    # Convert the number to string and split by groups of 3 digits
    num_str = str(number)
    num_groups = [int(num_str[i:i+3]) for i in range(0, len(num_str), 3)]

    # Initialize the result list
    result = []

    # Iterate over each group of digits starting from the least significant digit
    for i, group in enumerate(reversed(num_groups):
        # If the current group has leading zeros, skip it
        if group == 0:
            continue
        # Get the corresponding word for the group and add it to the result list
        result.append(num_to_words(group))
        # Add the name of the scale (thousands, millions, billions) if needed
        if i != 0 and group != 0:
            result.append(thousands[len(num_groups)-i-1])

    # Join the words using spaces and return the final result
    return ' '.join(result[: : :-1]).strip()

```

We first define dictionaries for converting single digits, double digits, and multiples of ten. Then we define a helper function `num_to_words()` which converts a number up to 999 into its word representation.

Next, we check if the input is out of range and raise a `ValueError` if it is. We convert the input integer to a string and split it into groups of 3 digits, then iterate over them from right to left (least significant to most significant) while adding their word representations to the result list. Finally, we join the words using spaces and return the resulting string after stripping extra whitespace.


Note that we reverse the order of the groups before joining them because we want to start with the smallest scale (hundreds) and work our way up to the largest (trillions). Also note that we strip extra whitespace at the end of the resulting string to remove any trailing space characters.
