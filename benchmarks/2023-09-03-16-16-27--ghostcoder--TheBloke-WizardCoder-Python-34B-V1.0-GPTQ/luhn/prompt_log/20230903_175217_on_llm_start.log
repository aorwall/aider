### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.

The [Luhn algorithm][luhn] is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.

The task is to check if a given string is valid.

## Validating a Number

Strings of length 1 or less are not valid.
Spaces are allowed in the input, but they should be stripped before checking.
All other non-digit characters are disallowed.

### Example 1: valid credit card number

```text
4539 3195 0343 6467
```

The first step of the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit, starting from the right.
We will be doubling

```text
4_3_ 3_9_ 0_4_ 6_6_
```

If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9 then subtract 9 from the product.
The results of our doubling:

```text
8569 6195 0383 3437
```

Then sum all of the digits:

```text
8+5+6+9+6+1+9+5+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80
```

If the sum is evenly divisible by 10, then the number is valid.
This number is valid!

### Example 2: invalid credit card number

```text
8273 1232 7352 0569
```

Double the second digits, starting from the right

```text
7253 2262 5312 0539
```

Sum the digits

```text
7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57
```

57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so this number is not valid.

### Response:
Here's an implementation for the `Luhn` class that checks if a given credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm:
Filepath: luhn.py
```
class Luhn:
    def __init__(self, card_num):
        self.card_num = ''.join([c for c in str(card_num) if c.isdigit()]) # remove spaces and non-numeric characters


    def valid(self):
        if len(self.card_num) <= 1:
            return False
        total = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(reversed(self.card_num):
            if (i % 2 == 1):
                doubled = int(num) * 2
                if doubled > 9:
                    doubled -= 9
            else:
                doubled = int(num)
            total += doubled
        return total % 10 == 0

```

Explanation:

- The `__init__()` method takes a string argument representing the credit card number and removes any non-numeric characters.
- The `valid()` method iterates through each digit of the credit card number, starting from the last one. If it's at an odd index (starting from 0), we double its value and subtract 9 if necessary. Then we add the resulting digit to the running total.
- Finally, we check if the total is divisible by 10. If yes, the credit card number is considered valid.

Note that we assume here that the input credit card numbers only contain numeric characters and spaces. We also strip out spaces before processing them. You can further improve the code to handle edge cases like negative numbers or strings with leading zeros.
