Solution:
We can solve this problem using nested loops where we iterate over rows and columns and fill them with values in a spiral pattern.


First, we create a list of lists to represent our matrix, initialized with zeros. Then, we define four variables `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` which represent the boundaries of the current spiral. We also define two pointers `row` and `col` to track the position of the current element being inserted into the matrix. 


Next, we start filling the matrix from the top left corner (position `(0,0)`) moving right until we reach the last column (`right`) and incrementing row pointer by one. After reaching the last column, we move downwards by incrementing col pointer by one and decrementing the `right` boundary by one. This continues until we reach the bottom row (`bottom`). Once we reach the bottom row, we move left by decrementing `right` and `col` and decrementing `bottom`. Similarly, we continue alternating between moving right, down, left, and up until we finish filling the entire matrix.


Finally, we return the resulting matrix.


Here's the implementation:


```python
def spiral_matrix(size):
    # Initialize empty matrix with zeros
    matrix = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    
    # Define initial positions and directions
    top, bottom, left, right = 0, size - 1, 0, size - 1
    row, col = 0, 0
    direction = 'r'
    num = 1
    
    while True:
        # Fill top row
        if direction == 'r':
            for i in range(left, right+1):
                matrix[top][i] = num
                num += 1
            top += 1
        # Fill right column
        elif direction == 'd':
            for i in range(top, bottom+1):
                matrix[i][right] = num
                num += 1
            right -= 1
        # Fill bottom row
        elif direction == 'l':
            for i in range(right, left-1, -1):
                matrix[bottom][i] = num
                num += 1
            bottom -= 1
        # Fill left column
        else:
            for i in range(bottom, top-1, -1):
                matrix[i][left] = num
                num += 1
            left += 1
        # Change direction after every iteration
        direction = {'r':'d', 'd':'l', 'l':'b', 'b':'r'}[direction]
        
        # Check if we finished iterating through the whole matrix
        if top > bottom or left > right:
            break
    
    return matrix
```

Let's test the function on some sample inputs:

```python
print(spiral_matrix(3))
# Output: [[1, 2, 3], [8, 9, 4], [7, 6, 5]]

print(spiral_matrix(4))
# Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [12, 13, 14, 5], [11, 16, 15, 6], [10, 9, 8, 7]]
```

This solution has time complexity O(N^2) since we need to visit each cell once, but only uses constant space O(1).
