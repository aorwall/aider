### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia][poker-hands] for an overview of poker hands.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: poker.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Here's one possible implementation for `best_hands`:

        elif has_pair(ranks):
            return (2, max(Counter(ranks).keys()))
        else:
            return (1, max(ranks))

    # convert hands to tuples of (score, high card)
    scores = [evaluate_hand(hand) for hand in hands]
    # find highest score
    max_score = max(scores)[0]
    # filter only hands with highest score
    winners = [i for i, s in enumerate(scores) if s[0] == max_score]
    # break ties based on high card
    winner_hands = [hands[i] for i in winners]
    winner_highest = max([max(hand, key=lambda c: get_rank(c)) for hand in winner_hands])
    # return indices of winning hands
    return [i for i, h in enumerate(hands) if winner_highest in h]

```

This implementation defines several helper functions to determine whether a hand meets certain criteria, such as having a pair, two pairs,
three of a kind, etc., and uses them to assign a score to each hand. It also includes special cases for royal flushes and straights.
The `evaluate_hand` function returns a tuple `(score, high_card)` where `score` is an integer representing the strength of the hand
and `high_card` is either `None` or the highest ranked card in the case of pairs, three of a kinds, and full houses. Then, it finds
the maximum score among all hands and filters out the hands that match this score. If there are multiple winners, it breaks ties
by selecting the hand with the highest card. Note that this implementation assumes that the input hands are valid, i.e. contain five 
distinct cards and do not contain invalid characters like "K" instead of "10".
