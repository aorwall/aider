When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the square input is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when the square value is not in the acceptable range        \nraise ValueError(\"square must be between 1 and 64\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grains.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

We need to add implementations for them. \n\nFor the `square()` function, we check whether the input `number` is within the valid range of values which is between 1 and 64. If it is outside this range, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message using the `raise` statement. Otherwise, we calculate the number of grains of wheat on that square by raising 2 to the power of `(number - 1)` since the number of grains doubles on each subsequent square starting from 1 grain on square 1. \n\n\nFor the `total()` function, we simply calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 64 raised to the power of 2 and subtract 1 to get the total number of grains of wheat on the chessboard. Note that we start at index 0 instead of 1 because the first element in the list is already 2^0 = 1.",

However, this approach is not necessary since there is a formula to directly compute the total number of grains of wheat without looping through them. The total number of grains of wheat on the board can be calculated as 2^64 - 1, which gives us the same result as the previous implementation but with much better performance. We don't need to check for any invalid inputs here since it's guaranteed that the input will always be valid based on the problem statement. Therefore, I removed the try-except block and just returned the value directly.",
