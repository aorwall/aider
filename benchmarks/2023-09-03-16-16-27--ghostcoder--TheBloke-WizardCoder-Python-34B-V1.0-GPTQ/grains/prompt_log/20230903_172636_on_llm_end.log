Here's the modified code for grains.py file:

```python
def square(number):
    """Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a single square.

    Args:
        number (int): A positive integer representing the square on the chessboard.

    Returns:
        int: The number of grains of wheat on that square.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the square is less than 1 or greater than 64.
    """
    if number < 1 or number > 64:
        raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
    return 2 ** (number - 1)


def total():
    """Calculate the total number of grains of wheat on all squares of the chessboard.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of grains of wheat on the chessboard.
    """
    return sum([2 ** i for i in range(65)]) - 1
```

Explanation:

In the original code, there was no implementation provided for either function. We need to add implementations for them. 

For the `square()` function, we check whether the input `number` is within the valid range of values which is between 1 and 64. If it is outside this range, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message using the `raise` statement. Otherwise, we calculate the number of grains of wheat on that square by raising 2 to the power of `(number - 1)` since the number of grains doubles on each subsequent square starting from 1 grain on square 1. 


For the `total()` function, we simply calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 64 raised to the power of 2 and subtract 1 to get the total number of grains of wheat on the chessboard. Note that we start at index 0 instead of 1 because the first element in the list is already 2^0 = 1.
