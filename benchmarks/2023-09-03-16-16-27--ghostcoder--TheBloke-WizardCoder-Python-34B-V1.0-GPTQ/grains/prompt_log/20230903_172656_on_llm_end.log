Here's the corrected implementation of `grains.py`:

```python
def square(number):
    """Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a single square.
    
    Args:
        number (int): A positive integer representing the square on the chessboard.
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of grains of wheat on that square.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the square is less than 1 or greater than 64.
    """
    if number < 1 or number > 64:
        raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
    return 2**(number-1)


def total():
    """Calculate the total number of grains of wheat on all squares of the chessboard."""
    return 2**64 - 1
```

Explanation:

In the original implementation, the `total()` function was using a loop to calculate the total number of grains of wheat by iterating over each square from 1 to 64 and adding up their values. However, this approach is not necessary since there is a formula to directly compute the total number of grains of wheat without looping through them. The total number of grains of wheat on the board can be calculated as 2^64 - 1, which gives us the same result as the previous implementation but with much better performance. We don't need to check for any invalid inputs here since it's guaranteed that the input will always be valid based on the problem statement. Therefore, I removed the try-except block and just returned the value directly.
