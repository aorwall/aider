### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince.
The king promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up.
Knowing that the king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains of wheat.
One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number of grains doubling on each successive square.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:

- how many grains were on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the square input is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the square value is not in the acceptable range        
raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
```

### Response:
Here's the modified code for grains.py file:
Filepath: grains.py
```
def square(number):
    """Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a single square.
    
    Args:
        number (int): A positive integer representing the square on the chessboard.
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of grains of wheat on that square.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the square is less than 1 or greater than 64.
    """
    if number < 1 or number > 64:
        raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
    return 2 ** (number - 1)


def total():
    """Calculate the total number of grains of wheat on all squares of the chessboard.
    
    Returns:
        int: The total number of grains of wheat on the chessboard.
    """
    return sum([2 ** i for i in range(65)]) - 1

```

Explanation:

In the original code, there was no implementation provided for either function. We need to add implementations for them. 

For the `square()` function, we check whether the input `number` is within the valid range of values which is between 1 and 64. If it is outside this range, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message using the `raise` statement. Otherwise, we calculate the number of grains of wheat on that square by raising 2 to the power of `(number - 1)` since the number of grains doubles on each subsequent square starting from 1 grain on square 1. 


For the `total()` function, we simply calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 64 raised to the power of 2 and subtract 1 to get the total number of grains of wheat on the chessboard. Note that we start at index 0 instead of 1 because the first element in the list is already 2^0 = 1.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grains.py to resolve the errors.
