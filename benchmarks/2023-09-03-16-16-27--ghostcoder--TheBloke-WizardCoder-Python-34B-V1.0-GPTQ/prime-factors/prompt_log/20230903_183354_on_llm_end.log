Solution:

We need to find all the prime numbers which divide the given number completely.
To do this, we start with the smallest prime number (which is 2) and keep dividing it until there is no remainder when divided by 2. Then we move to the next prime number (which is 3), and repeat the process until the quotient becomes 1. If at any point, the quotient becomes less than the current prime number, we stop because it means we have found all the prime factors.


Here's how we can implement this logic using Python code:


```python
def factors(value):
    """Return a list of prime factors of a given number."""
    primes = []
    while value % 2 == 0:
        primes.append(2)
        value //= 2
    
    # Check odd numbers starting from 3
    num = 3
    while value > 1:
        if value % num == 0:
            primes.append(num)
            value //= num
        else:
            num += 2
    
    return primes
```

Let's test the function with some examples:

```python
print(factors(60))  # Output: [2, 2, 3, 5]
print(factors(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
print(factors(8))   # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
```

The output shows the correct prime factors of the given input values.
