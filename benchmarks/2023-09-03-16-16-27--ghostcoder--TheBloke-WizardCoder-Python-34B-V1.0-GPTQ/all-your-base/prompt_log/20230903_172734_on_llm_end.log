Here's the modified implementation of the `rebase()` function that raises appropriate exceptions when needed:

```python
def rebase(input_base, digits, output_base):
    # Check if input_base and output_base are valid.
    if input_base < 2 or output_base < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input and Output bases must be greater than or equal to 2.")
    
    # Convert list of digits to integer value using input_base.
    num = sum([digits[i] * input_base ** (len(digits)-1 - i) for i in range(len(digits))])
    
    # Initialize result list.
    res = []
    while num > 0:
        res.append(num % output_base)
        num //= output_base
    
    return res[::-1]
```

We added two checks at the beginning of the function to ensure that both input_base and output_base are greater than or equal to 2. If either of them is less than 2, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message. We also changed the loop condition to check whether `num` is greater than zero instead of checking if it's truthy since `num` could be zero which would cause an infinite loop otherwise. Finally, we reversed the resulting list before returning it so that the least significant digit appears first.
