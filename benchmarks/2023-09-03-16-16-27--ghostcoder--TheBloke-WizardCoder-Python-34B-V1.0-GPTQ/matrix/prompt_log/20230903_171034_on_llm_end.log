Here is an implementation of the `Matrix` class:

```python
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        self._matrix = [[int(num) for num in line.split()] for line in matrix_string.strip().split('\n')]

    
    def row(self, index):
        return self._matrix[index - 1] if 0 < index <= len(self._matrix) else []

    
    def column(self, index):
        return [row[index - 1] for row in self._matrix] if 0 < index <= len(self._matrix[0]) else []
```

Explanation:

We start by initializing the `_matrix` attribute of the class using a list comprehension that splits the input string on newline characters (`\n`) and then further splits each resulting line into integers.


Then we define two methods:

- The `row()` method takes an integer argument `index`, which represents the row number (starting from 1). We subtract 1 from the index since lists are zero-indexed in Python. If the index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the matrix, we return an empty list. Otherwise, we return the corresponding row of the matrix.
- The `column()` method also takes an integer argument `index`. We check whether the index is valid before returning the corresponding column of the matrix, again using a list comprehension to extract the values from each row.


Note that we assume that all rows have the same length, so we can simply access the i-th element of each row to get the j-th column. If this assumption doesn't hold, we would need to transpose the matrix first. However, this isn't necessary for the problem statement.
