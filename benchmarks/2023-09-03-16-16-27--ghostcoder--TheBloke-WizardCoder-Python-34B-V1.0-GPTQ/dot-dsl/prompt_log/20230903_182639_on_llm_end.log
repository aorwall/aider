There seems to be a missing closing parenthesis in the above code snippet. It should be:

```python
elif line.endswith(';'):
    key, value = map(str.strip, line[:-1].rsplit(' ', maxsplit=1))  # added closing parenthesis
    attributes[current_element][key] = value
```

Also, there's a typo in the function name `parese_node`, which should be corrected to `parse_node`:

```python
def parse_node(line):
    ...

def parse_edge(line):
    ...
```

With those changes, the code should work correctly.
