Solution:
We need to check whether there are any repeated letters in the string. One way to do this is to convert the string into lowercase using `str.lower()` method and remove all non-alphabetic characters using `re` module. Then, we can create a set out of the remaining alphabets and compare its length with the length of the cleaned string. If their lengths are equal, then the string is an isogram.


Here's the modified code:

```python
import re

def is_isogram(string):
    # Convert string to lower case and remove non-alphabetical characters
    string = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', '', string).lower()
    
    # Create a set of unique letters in the string
    unique_letters = set(string)
    
    # Check if length of set is same as length of string
    return len(unique_letters) == len(string)
```

Note: We used regular expression `[^a-zA-Z]` which matches any character that is not an alphabet. This ensures that only alphabets remain in the string after removing all other characters like space, punctuations etc.
