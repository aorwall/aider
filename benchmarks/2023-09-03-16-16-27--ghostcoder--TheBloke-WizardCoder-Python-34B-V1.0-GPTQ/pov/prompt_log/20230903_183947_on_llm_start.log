### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Reparent a tree on a selected node.

A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.
That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.

This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.
For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:

```text
    +------0------+
    |      |      |
  +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+
  |   |  |   |  |   |
  4   5  6   7  8   9
```

But there is no inherent direction in a tree.
The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.
So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:

```text
        6
        |
  +-----2-----+
  |           |
  7     +-----0-----+
        |           |
      +-1-+       +-3-+
      |   |       |   |
      4   5       8   9
```

This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.
So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.

This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV
raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")

#when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.
raise ValueError("No path found")
```
