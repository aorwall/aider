When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV\nraise ValueError(\"Tree could not be reoriented\")\n\n#when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.\nraise ValueError(\"No path found\")\n```\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
