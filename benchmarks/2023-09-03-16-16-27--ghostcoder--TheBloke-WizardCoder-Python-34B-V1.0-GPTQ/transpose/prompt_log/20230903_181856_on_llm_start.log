Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows.
See [transpose][].

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: transpose.py
```python
def transpose(lines):
    pass

```
