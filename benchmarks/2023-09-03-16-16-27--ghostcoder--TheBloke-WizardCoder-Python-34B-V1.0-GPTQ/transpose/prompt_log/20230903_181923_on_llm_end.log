Solution:

We can solve this problem using nested loops.

First, we need to find out the maximum length of any line in the input lines so that we can pad them with spaces to make them equal length. We can do this using `max()` function and passing a key parameter which returns the length of each element in the list. Then, we create a new list where each element is padded with spaces to match the max_length.

Next, we iterate over the columns (i) and append the character at index i from each line to form a new string. If there are no more characters in a line after padding, we add space instead.
Finally, we join these strings with newline character to get the transposed text.


Here's the implementation: 

```python
def transpose(lines):
    # Find the maximum length of any line in the input
    max_len = len(max(lines, key=lambda x: len(x))
    
    # Pad each line with spaces to match the maximum length
    lines = [line.ljust(max_len) for line in lines]
    
    # Initialize empty list to store transposed lines
    transposed_lines = []
    
    # Iterate over columns
    for i in range(max_len):
        col = ""
        # Append the character at index i from each line to form a new string
        for line in lines:
            col += line[i]
        # Add the new string to transposed_lines
        transposed_lines.append(col)
    
    # Join the transposed lines with newline character
    return "\n".join(transposed_lines)
```

Let's test our solution with some examples:

```python
>>> print(transpose(['ABC', 'DEF'])
AD
BE
CF

>>> print(transpose(['AB', 'DE'])
AD
BE

>>> print(transpose(['A', 'BCD', 'EFGH'])
AEF
BDF
CGH
```

Note that the first example has two lines of unequal length but the second one still works correctly because we have added spaces to make both lines equal length before transposition.
