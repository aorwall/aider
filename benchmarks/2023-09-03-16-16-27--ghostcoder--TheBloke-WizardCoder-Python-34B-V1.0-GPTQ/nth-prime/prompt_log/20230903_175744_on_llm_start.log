### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `prime()` function receives malformed input. Since this exercise deals only with _positive_ numbers, any number < 1 is malformed.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the prime function receives malformed input
raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')
```

### Response:
Here's the implementation of the `nth_prime` function which finds the nth prime number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    primes = []
    sieve = [True] * (limit+1)
    p = 2
    while len(primes) <= limit:
        if sieve[p]:
            primes.append(p)
            for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p):
                sieve[i] = False
        p += 1
    return primes

def nth_prime(n):
    if n == 0:
        raise ValueError("There is no zeroth prime")
    elif n > 0:
        primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(n*math.log(n)+10)
        return primes[n-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Negative values are invalid inputs.")
```

The `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function generates all prime numbers up to a given limit by iteratively marking multiples of each prime starting from 2. We then simply return the nth prime from the list generated.

Note that we add a buffer of 10 to the upper bound of the sieve to ensure that there are enough primes to find the nth prime even if our initial guess isn't large enough. If we didn't have this buffer, some test cases might fail due to index out of bounds errors. 

We also check for negative inputs and raise a `ValueError` if n is less than or equal to zero since there cannot be a zeroth prime or a prime at a negative position.
