Here's the implementation of the `nth_prime` function which finds the nth prime number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    primes = []
    sieve = [True] * (limit+1)
    p = 2
    while len(primes) <= limit:
        if sieve[p]:
            primes.append(p)
            for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p):
                sieve[i] = False
        p += 1
    return primes

def nth_prime(n):
    if n == 0:
        raise ValueError("There is no zeroth prime")
    elif n > 0:
        primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(n*math.log(n)+10)
        return primes[n-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Negative values are invalid inputs.")
```

The `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function generates all prime numbers up to a given limit by iteratively marking multiples of each prime starting from 2. We then simply return the nth prime from the list generated.

Note that we add a buffer of 10 to the upper bound of the sieve to ensure that there are enough primes to find the nth prime even if our initial guess isn't large enough. If we didn't have this buffer, some test cases might fail due to index out of bounds errors. 

We also check for negative inputs and raise a `ValueError` if n is less than or equal to zero since there cannot be a zeroth prime or a prime at a negative position.
