Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.\n\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.\nraise ValueError(\"The game has already ended.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

We also define constants `STATUS_WIN`, `STATUS_LOSE`, and `STATUS_ONGOING` which represent the three possible states of the game.\n\nIn `__init__()`, we convert the secret word into a list so that we can index it later on. We create two empty lists - `correct_chars` to keep track of all correctly guessed characters and `incorrect_chars` to keep track of all incorrectly guessed characters.\n\nIn `guess()` method, we first check whether the game has already ended using `get_status()`. If yes, we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we check if the character has been guessed before by checking if it exists either in `correct_chars` or `incorrect_chars`. If it does, we simply return its presence in `correct_chars`. If not, we add it to `incorrect_chars` and subtract 1 from `current_lives` if it doesn't exist in the `secret_word`. If `current_lives` becomes zero, we update the `status` to `STATUS_LOSE`. Finally, we return `True` if the character was present in the `secret_word` and `False` otherwise.\n\nIn `get_masked_word()`, we iterate through each character in the `secret_word` and replace it with `'*'` if it hasn't been guessed yet (i.e., not in `correct_chars`).\n\nIn `get_status()`, we check if there are no `_` left in the masked word, then the game is won (`STATUS_WIN`), if `current_lives` have reached zero, then the game is lost (`STATUS_LOSE`) and otherwise, the game is ongoing (`STATUS_ONGOING`). We update the value of `status` accordingly and return it.",
