### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.
It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write "the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.
You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

# Instructions append

## Python Special Instructions

A third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.
raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

        return self.status

```

Explanation:

We initialize the instance variables `secret_word`, `correct_chars`, `incorrect_chars`, `max_lives`, and `current_lives`. We also define constants `STATUS_WIN`, `STATUS_LOSE`, and `STATUS_ONGOING` which represent the three possible states of the game.

In `__init__()`, we convert the secret word into a list so that we can index it later on. We create two empty lists - `correct_chars` to keep track of all correctly guessed characters and `incorrect_chars` to keep track of all incorrectly guessed characters.

In `guess()` method, we first check whether the game has already ended using `get_status()`. If yes, we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we check if the character has been guessed before by checking if it exists either in `correct_chars` or `incorrect_chars`. If it does, we simply return its presence in `correct_chars`. If not, we add it to `incorrect_chars` and subtract 1 from `current_lives` if it doesn't exist in the `secret_word`. If `current_lives` becomes zero, we update the `status` to `STATUS_LOSE`. Finally, we return `True` if the character was present in the `secret_word` and `False` otherwise.

In `get_masked_word()`, we iterate through each character in the `secret_word` and replace it with `'*'` if it hasn't been guessed yet (i.e., not in `correct_chars`).

In `get_status()`, we check if there are no `_` left in the masked word, then the game is won (`STATUS_WIN`), if `current_lives` have reached zero, then the game is lost (`STATUS_LOSE`) and otherwise, the game is ongoing (`STATUS_ONGOING`). We update the value of `status` accordingly and return it.
