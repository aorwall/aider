Here's the modified hangman.py file with the implemented methods:

```python
# Game status categories
STATUS_WIN = 'win'
STATUS_LOSE = 'lose'
STATUS_ONGOING = 'ongoing'

class Hangman:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.secret_word = list(word)
        self.correct_chars = []
        self.incorrect_chars = set()
        self.max_lives = 9
        self.current_lives = max_lives
        
    def guess(self, char):
        """Takes a character as input and returns True if correct, False otherwise"""
        if self.get_status() != STATUS_ONGOING:
            # If the game has ended, raise an exception.
            raise ValueError("Game has already ended!")
        elif char in self.correct_chars or char in self.incorrect_chars:
            return bool(char in self.correct_chars)
        else:
            if char in self.secret_word:
                self.correct_chars.append(char)
                return True
            else:
                self.incorrect_chars.add(char)
                self.current_lives -= 1
                if self.current_lives == 0:
                    self.status = STATUS_LOSE
                return False

    def get_status(self):
        """Returns the current status of the game."""
        if '_' not in self.get_masked_word():
            self.status = STATUS_WIN
        elif self.current_lives <= 0:
            self.status = STATUS_LOSE

Explanation:

We initialize the instance variables `secret_word`, `correct_chars`, `incorrect_chars`, `max_lives`, and `current_lives`. We also define constants `STATUS_WIN`, `STATUS_LOSE`, and `STATUS_ONGOING` which represent the three possible states of the game.

In `__init__()`, we convert the secret word into a list so that we can index it later on. We create two empty lists - `correct_chars` to keep track of all correctly guessed characters and `incorrect_chars` to keep track of all incorrectly guessed characters.

In `guess()` method, we first check whether the game has already ended using `get_status()`. If yes, we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we check if the character has been guessed before by checking if it exists either in `correct_chars` or `incorrect_chars`. If it does, we simply return its presence in `correct_chars`. If not, we add it to `incorrect_chars` and subtract 1 from `current_lives` if it doesn't exist in the `secret_word`. If `current_lives` becomes zero, we update the `status` to `STATUS_LOSE`. Finally, we return `True` if the character was present in the `secret_word` and `False` otherwise.

In `get_masked_word()`, we iterate through each character in the `secret_word` and replace it with `'*'` if it hasn't been guessed yet (i.e., not in `correct_chars`).

In `get_status()`, we check if there are no `_` left in the masked word, then the game is won (`STATUS_WIN`), if `current_lives` have reached zero, then the game is lost (`STATUS_LOSE`) and otherwise, the game is ongoing (`STATUS_ONGOING`). We update the value of `status` accordingly and return it.
