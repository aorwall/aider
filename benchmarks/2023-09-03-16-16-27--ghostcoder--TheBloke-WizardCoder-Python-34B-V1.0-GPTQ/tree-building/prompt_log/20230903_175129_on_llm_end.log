The given code defines a `Record` class with two attributes `record_id` and `parent_id`, which represents an item in the input list of records that is used to build the tree. The `Node` class has one attribute `node_id` and a list `children`. It also contains a method `BuildTree()` that takes a list of `Record` objects as its argument and returns the root node of the built tree. However, there are some issues with this implementation:

- If the first element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to zero, it raises an error.
- If the last element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` less than its `parent_id`, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` greater than the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` greater than its index in the list, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` less than its index in the list, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` equal to its `record_id`, it raises an error.
- If multiple elements exist with the same `record_id`, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` that does not exist in the previous elements, it raises an error.

To fix these issues, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []

def BuildTree(records):
    # Create a dictionary to store nodes by their id
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}
    
    # Find the root node (the one with parent_id = 0)
    try:
        root = nodes[0]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    
    # Iterate through each record and add children to their respective parents
    for rec in records:
        if rec.record_id <= 0 or rec.record_id >= len(records):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        elif rec.parent_id >= rec.record_id:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        else:
            try:
                nodes[rec.parent_id].children.append(nodes[rec.record_id])
            except KeyError:
                raise ValueError("Broken tree")
    
    return root
```

This modified version creates a dictionary of all nodes using the `record_id` as keys, then iterates through the records and adds them as children to their respective parents based on their `parent_id`. This approach avoids sorting the input list and allows us to handle cases where the input may contain duplicate `record_id` values. We also check for invalid inputs such as negative indices and non-existent parent ids before creating the tree. Note that this implementation assumes that the input list only contains valid records, so no additional checks are needed for those.
