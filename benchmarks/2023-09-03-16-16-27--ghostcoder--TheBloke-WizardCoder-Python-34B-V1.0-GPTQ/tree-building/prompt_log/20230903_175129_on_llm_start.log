### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Refactor a tree building algorithm.

Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.
However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.
Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.

Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.
The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.
The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).
All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.

An example tree:

```text
root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)
|-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)
|    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)
|    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)
+-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)
|    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)
+-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.

### Response:
The given code defines a `Record` class with two attributes `record_id` and `parent_id`, which represents an item in the input list of records that is used to build the tree. The `Node` class has one attribute `node_id` and a list `children`. It also contains a method `BuildTree()` that takes a list of `Record` objects as its argument and returns the root node of the built tree. However, there are some issues with this implementation:

- If the first element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to zero, it raises an error.
- If the last element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` less than its `parent_id`, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` greater than the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` greater than its index in the list, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` less than its index in the list, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` equal to its `record_id`, it raises an error.
- If multiple elements exist with the same `record_id`, it raises an error.
- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` that does not exist in the previous elements, it raises an error.

To fix these issues, we can modify the code as follows:
Filepath: tree_building.py
```
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []

def BuildTree(records):
    # Create a dictionary to store nodes by their id
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}

    # Find the root node (the one with parent_id = 0)
    try:
        root = nodes[0]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")

    # Iterate through each record and add children to their respective parents
    for rec in records:
        if rec.record_id <= 0 or rec.record_id >= len(records):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        elif rec.parent_id >= rec.record_id:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        else:
            try:
                nodes[rec.parent_id].children.append(nodes[rec.record_id])
            except KeyError:
                raise ValueError("Broken tree")

    return root

```

This modified version creates a dictionary of all nodes using the `record_id` as keys, then iterates through the records and adds them as children to their respective parents based on their `parent_id`. This approach avoids sorting the input list and allows us to handle cases where the input may contain duplicate `record_id` values. We also check for invalid inputs such as negative indices and non-existent parent ids before creating the tree. Note that this implementation assumes that the input list only contains valid records, so no additional checks are needed for those.
