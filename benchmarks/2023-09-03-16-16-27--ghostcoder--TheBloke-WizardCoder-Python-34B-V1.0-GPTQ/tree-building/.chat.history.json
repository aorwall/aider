When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to \"throw\" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

The `Node` class has one attribute `node_id` and a list `children`. It also contains a method `BuildTree()` that takes a list of `Record` objects as its argument and returns the root node of the built tree. However, there are some issues with this implementation:\n\n- If the first element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to zero, it raises an error.\n- If the last element in the input list does not have `record_id` equal to the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` less than its `parent_id`, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `record_id` greater than the length of the list minus one, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` greater than its index in the list, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` less than its index in the list, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` equal to its `record_id`, it raises an error.\n- If multiple elements exist with the same `record_id`, it raises an error.\n- If any element in the input list has a `parent_id` that does not exist in the previous elements, it raises an error.\n\nTo fix these issues, we can modify the code as follows:",

We iterate over each record in `records`, create a new Node object using its `record_id` and add it to the `nodes` dictionary with key as `record_id` and value as the created Node object.\n3. We then find the root node by accessing the Node object with key 0 from the `nodes` dictionary.\n4. For every other record, we check if the `parent_id` is present in the `nodes` dictionary. If yes, we append the child node to its parent's list of children. Otherwise, we raise a `KeyError` since the tree is broken.\n5. Finally, we return the root node.\n6. In case there is no record with `record_id=0`, we raise a `ValueError` because the input is invalid.\n7. Also, we skip adding the first record (with `record_id=0`) to the `nodes` dictionary since it represents the root node which has no parent.",
