Here is the corrected implementation for `difference_of_squares.py`:

```python
import math

def square_of_sum(n):
    """Returns the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers"""
    return int((n * (n + 1) / 2) ** 2)


def sum_of_squares(n):
    """Returns the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers"""
    return int(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6)

def difference_of_squares(n):
    """Returns the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers."""
    return square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
```

Explanation:

We need to calculate the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers which can be done using the formula `(n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2`. We also need to calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers which can be calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6`. The difference between these two values gives us the answer.


Now all the tests should pass successfully.
