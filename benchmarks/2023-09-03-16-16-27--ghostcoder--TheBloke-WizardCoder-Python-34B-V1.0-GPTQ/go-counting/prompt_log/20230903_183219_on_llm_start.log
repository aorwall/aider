### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Count the scored points on a Go board.

In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.
The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.

Write a function that determines the territory of each player.
You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.

Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.

Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.
In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).
Empty spaces represent empty intersections.

```text
+----+
|IOOI|
|O  O|
|O OI|
|IOI |
+----+
```

To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the coordinates for the piece are invalid
raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')
```

            for dx, dy in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)):

        result = {"W":set(), "B":set()}

        return result

```

In this implementation, we have added a check to ensure that the input coordinates are within bounds before traversing the board. If the coordinates are out of bounds, we raise a `ValueError`. We also initialized the `visited` matrix inside the `dfs()` function instead of outside so that it gets reset every time the function is called. This ensures that multiple calls to `territory()` do not interfere with each other. Finally, we updated the `result` dictionary directly in the `territories()` method instead of creating a new variable `groups` which was not used anywhere else.
