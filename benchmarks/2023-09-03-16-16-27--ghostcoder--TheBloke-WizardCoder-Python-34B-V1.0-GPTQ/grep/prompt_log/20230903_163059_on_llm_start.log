Act as a an automated AI with superior programming skills.
You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 
When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

When you update or add a new file you must follow the rules below:
* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST include all the original code in the updated files, even if it hasn't been altered.  
* YOU SHOULD avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.

ALL files should be presented in the following format:

### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Search files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.

The Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.
Your task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.

The `grep` command takes three arguments:

1. The string to search for.
2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.
3. One or more files to search in.

It then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.
When searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').

## Flags

The `grep` command supports the following flags:

- `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).
- `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.
- `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.
- `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grep.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: grep.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's an implementation of the `grep` function:
```python
import os
from typing import List

def grep(pattern: str, flags: List[str], files: List[str]) -> None:
    # Initialize variables based on flags
    show_line_numbers = '-n' in flags
    list_files = '-l' in flags
    ignore_case = '-i' in flags
    exact_match = '-x' in flags
    inverted_search = '-v' in flags
    
    if inverted_search:
        pattern = '(?!' + pattern + ')'
        
    regex_flags = re.IGNORECASE if ignore_case else 0
    
    # Compile the regular expression
    if exact_match:
        regex = f"^{re.escape(pattern)}$"
    else:
        regex = re.compile(f".*{re.escape(pattern)}", regex_flags)
    
    # Iterate through the files
    for file_name in files:
        try:
            with open(file_name, "r") as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
                
                # Check each line against the pattern
                for index, line in enumerate(lines):
                    if ignore_case:
                        line = line.lower()
                    if regex.search(line):
                        if inverted_search:
                            continue
                            
                        if list_files:
                            print(file_name)
                            break
                            
                        elif show_line_numbers:
                            print(f"{file_name}:{index+1}:{line}", end='')
                        else:
                            print(line, end='')
                    else:
                        if inverted_search:
                            print(file_name)
                            break
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"{file_name}: No such file or directory.")
```

This implementation uses Python's built-in `re` module to handle regular expressions. We first check for the presence of flags and set some variables accordingly. Then, we compile the regular expression based on the given pattern and flags. If the `-x` flag is used, we wrap it in `^` and `$` to ensure that it matches the whole line. We iterate through the input files and read their content into memory. For each line, we convert it to lowercase if the `-i` flag is provided. We then check whether the line matches the regular expression. If it does, we either print the file name (`-l`), the line number and the line itself (`-n`), or just the line itself. If the `-v` flag is used, we skip printing anything when there's a match and instead print the file name if no lines match. If there was no match, we print the file name if the `-v` flag is used. Note that this implementation assumes that the input files are text files and can be opened in read mode. It doesn't support binary files or reading from stdin.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grep.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: grep.py
```python
def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    pass
