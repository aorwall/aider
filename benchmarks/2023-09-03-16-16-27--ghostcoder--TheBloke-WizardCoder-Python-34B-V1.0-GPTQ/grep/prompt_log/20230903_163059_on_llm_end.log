Here's an implementation of the `grep` function:

```python
import os
from typing import List

def grep(pattern: str, flags: List[str], files: List[str]) -> None:
    # Initialize variables based on flags
    show_line_numbers = '-n' in flags
    list_files = '-l' in flags
    ignore_case = '-i' in flags
    exact_match = '-x' in flags
    inverted_search = '-v' in flags
    
    if inverted_search:
        pattern = '(?!' + pattern + ')'
        
    regex_flags = re.IGNORECASE if ignore_case else 0
    
    # Compile the regular expression
    if exact_match:
        regex = f"^{re.escape(pattern)}$"
    else:
        regex = re.compile(f".*{re.escape(pattern)}", regex_flags)
    
    # Iterate through the files
    for file_name in files:
        try:
            with open(file_name, "r") as file:
                lines = file.readlines()
                
                # Check each line against the pattern
                for index, line in enumerate(lines):
                    if ignore_case:
                        line = line.lower()
                    if regex.search(line):
                        if inverted_search:
                            continue
                            
                        if list_files:
                            print(file_name)
                            break
                            
                        elif show_line_numbers:
                            print(f"{file_name}:{index+1}:{line}", end='')
                        else:
                            print(line, end='')
                    else:
                        if inverted_search:
                            print(file_name)
                            break
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"{file_name}: No such file or directory.")
```

This implementation uses Python's built-in `re` module to handle regular expressions. We first check for the presence of flags and set some variables accordingly. Then, we compile the regular expression based on the given pattern and flags. If the `-x` flag is used, we wrap it in `^` and `$` to ensure that it matches the whole line. We iterate through the input files and read their content into memory. For each line, we convert it to lowercase if the `-i` flag is provided. We then check whether the line matches the regular expression. If it does, we either print the file name (`-l`), the line number and the line itself (`-n`), or just the line itself. If the `-v` flag is used, we skip printing anything when there's a match and instead print the file name if no lines match. If there was no match, we print the file name if the `-v` flag is used. Note that this implementation assumes that the input files are text files and can be opened in read mode. It doesn't support binary files or reading from stdin.
