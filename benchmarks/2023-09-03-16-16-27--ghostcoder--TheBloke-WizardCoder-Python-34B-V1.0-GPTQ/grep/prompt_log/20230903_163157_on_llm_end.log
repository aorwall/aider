Here's one possible solution for `grep()` function that resolves all the issues mentioned in the output:

```python
import os
from typing import List

def grep(pattern: str, flags: List[str], filepaths: List[str]) -> str:
    """Searches for pattern in each file specified by filepaths and returns matching lines.
    
    Args:
        pattern: The search term as a string.
        flags: A list of command-line flags.
        filepaths: A list of paths to files to be searched.
    
    Returns:
        A string containing the matched lines from the input files or an empty string if no matches found.
    """
    # Initialize variables based on flags
    case_sensitive = '-i' not in flags
    verbose = '-v' in flags
    print_filenames = '-l' in flags
    count_matches = '-c' in flags
    recursive = '-r' in flags
    ignore_binary = '-b' in flags
    
    # Create a set of valid flags for error checking later
    valid_flags = {'-i', '-v', '-l', '-c', '-r', '-b'}
    invalid_flags = [f for f in flags if f not in valid_flags]
    if len(invalid_flags) > 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid flag(s): {}".format(', '.join(invalid_flags)) + "\nValid flags are -i, -v, -l, -c, -r, -b")
    
    # If searching recursively, find all files under directories in filepaths

                    encoding = 'utf8'
                except UnicodeDecodeError:

```

This implementation uses the following logic:

- Check for invalid flags and raise an exception if any are found.
- If `-r` flag is present, iterate over all files within the directory tree starting at each given filepath.
- Open each file in binary mode so we can handle non-UTF-8 encodings correctly.
- Try to decode the data as UTF-8, skipping binary files if `-b` is not present.
- Split the decoded text into lines using `\n`.
- For each line, check if it contains the pattern (case sensitive or insensitive depending on whether `-i` is present).
- If there's a match, add either the entire line or just the line number to the results list.
- If `-c` is present, count the number of matches per file instead of adding them to the results list.
- Finally, join the results together into a single string separated by newline characters and return it. If there were no matches, return an empty string.
