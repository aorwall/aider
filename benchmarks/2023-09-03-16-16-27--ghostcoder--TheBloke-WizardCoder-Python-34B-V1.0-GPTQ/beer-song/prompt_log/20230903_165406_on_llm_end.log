Here is a possible implementation for `beer_song.py`:

```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    """Recites the lyrics of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song starting at start."""
    if start < 1:
        raise ValueError("Start must be greater than zero")
    
    result = []
    current = max(start - take + 1, 1)
    while current <= start:
        line = f"{current} bottles of beer on the wall, {current} bottles of beer.\n"
        line += f"Take one down and pass it around, "
        next_num = current - 1 if current > 1 else 'no more'
        line += f"{next_num} bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n"
        result.append(line)
        current -= 1
    return result[:take]
```

This implementation uses string concatenation (`+`) to create each line of the song and appends them to a list. The loop starts at `max(start-take+1, 1)` so that we can handle cases where `take` is larger than `start`. We also check that `start >= 1`, since there are no negative number of bottles.

We can test this function with the following code:

```python
print('\n'.join(recite(10)) + '\n') # prints the first 10 lines of the song
print(''.join(recite(10, 5)) + '\n') # prints the first 5 verses of the song
print(''.join(recite(3)) + '\n') # prints the entire song up to 3 bottles
```

Output:

Note that in the second call to `recite()`, we join the resulting strings using an empty separator (`''`), which means that all the verses are printed without spaces between them. This allows us
