Here's a possible implementation using backtracking algorithm to find all possible chains of dominoes:

```python
from itertools import permutations

class Domino:
    def __init__(self, left, right):
        self.left = min(left, right)
        self.right = max(left, right)

    def matches(self, other):
        return self.right == other.left

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"[{self.left}|{self.right}]"


def can_chain(dominoes):
    if len(dominoes) < 2:
        return []

    # Create a list of Domino objects from input pairs
    dominos = [Domino(*pair) for pair in dominoes]

    # Find all unique permutations of dominoes
    perms = set(permutations(dominos))

    # Iterate over permutations until a valid chain is found
    for perm in perms:
        stack = [(0, [])
        while stack:
            idx, chain = stack.pop()
            if idx >= len(perm):
                yield chain
            else:
                next_idx = idx + 1
                if not chain or perm[next_idx].matches(chain[-1]):
                    stack.append((next_idx, chain + [perm[next_idx]))
                    
        # Check if the current chain is valid
        if chain[0].left == chain[-1].right:
            yield chain

# Test case
print(list(can_chain([[2, 1], [2, 3], [1, 3]])) # Should print [[1|2], [2|3], [3|1]], [3|2], [2|1], [1|3]]
print(can_chain([[1, 2], [4, 1], [2, 3]])   # Should print None
```

The `can_chain` function takes a list of pairs representing the dominoes and returns a generator object containing all possible valid chains.
It works by generating all permutations of the dominoes and checking if each permutation forms a valid chain. A valid chain starts and ends with the same number,
and each consecutive pair must match either horizontally or vertically. If it finds a valid chain, it yields it. Otherwise, it continues searching for more permutations.

We create a `Domino` class to represent each domino, which has two values (`left` and `right`) and a method `matches` to check if it can be placed after another domino.
Then, we iterate over all permutations of the dominoes and recursively build a chain starting at index 0. We keep track of the current position in the permutation
using a tuple `(index, chain)` in the `stack`. Whenever we reach the end of the permutation, we check if the chain is complete and valid, and if so, we yield it.
If there's no valid chain, the function returns an empty iterator.

Note that this approach generates all possible permutations of the input list, which could become very expensive for large inputs. There might exist more efficient algorithms to solve
this problem, but this one is simple and easy to understand.
