### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.

Note that not all verses are identical.

```text
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.

Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.

Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.

Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.

Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
Six green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.

Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
Five green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.

Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
Four green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.

Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.

Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.

One green bottle hanging on the wall,
One green bottle hanging on the wall,
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here is a possible implementation of `recite` that follows the given requirements:
```python
def recite(start, take=10):
    """Recites the song starting at start and taking take number of verses"""
    for i in range(take):
        # Calculate the current number of bottles based on the index i + start - 1 (since we are zero-indexed)
        num_bottles = start + i
        
        # Create the first line with pluralization rules for "green" and "bottle/bottles"
        line1 = f"{num_bottles} {'green bottle' if num_bottles == 1 else 'green bottles'} hanging on the wall,"
        print(line1)
        
        # Print the next lines using string formatting to handle singular and plural cases
        print(f"{line1}
{'And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,' if num_bottles > 1 else ''} there'll be {num_bottles-1} {'green bottle' if num_bottles-1 == 1 else 'green bottles'} hanging on the wall.")
        
        # Add an extra newline between each verse except for the last one
        if i < take - 1:
            print()
```

This implementation uses a loop to iterate over the desired number of verses (`take`), and calculates the correct number of bottles based on the starting point (`start`). It then constructs the first line of each verse dynamically by checking whether it should be singular or plural ("green bottle" vs. "green bottles"), and prints both lines of each verse.

The second line only appears up until the penultimate verse, so it is conditionally printed depending on the value of `i`. Finally, a blank line is added after every verse except for the last one, which makes the output more readable. Note that this implementation assumes that `take` is positive and does not check for invalid input values such as negative numbers or non-integer types.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bottle_song.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    pass
