Here is a possible implementation of `recite` that follows the given requirements:

```python
def recite(start, take=10):
    """Recites the song starting at start and taking take number of verses"""
    for i in range(take):
        # Calculate the current number of bottles based on the index i + start - 1 (since we are zero-indexed)
        num_bottles = start + i
        
        # Create the first line with pluralization rules for "green" and "bottle/bottles"
        line1 = f"{num_bottles} {'green bottle' if num_bottles == 1 else 'green bottles'} hanging on the wall,"
        print(line1)
        
        # Print the next lines using string formatting to handle singular and plural cases
        print(f"{line1}\n{'And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,' if num_bottles > 1 else ''} there'll be {num_bottles-1} {'green bottle' if num_bottles-1 == 1 else 'green bottles'} hanging on the wall.")
        
        # Add an extra newline between each verse except for the last one
        if i < take - 1:
            print()
```

This implementation uses a loop to iterate over the desired number of verses (`take`), and calculates the correct number of bottles based on the starting point (`start`). It then constructs the first line of each verse dynamically by checking whether it should be singular or plural ("green bottle" vs. "green bottles"), and prints both lines of each verse.

The second line only appears up until the penultimate verse, so it is conditionally printed depending on the value of `i`. Finally, a blank line is added after every verse except for the last one, which makes the output more readable. Note that this implementation assumes that `take` is positive and does not check for invalid input values such as negative numbers or non-integer types.
