It then constructs the first line of each verse dynamically by checking whether it should be singular or plural (\"green bottle\" vs. \"green bottles\"), and prints both lines of each verse.\n\nThe second line only appears up until the penultimate verse, so it is conditionally printed depending on the value of `i`. Finally, a blank line is added after every verse except for the last one, which makes the output more readable.
