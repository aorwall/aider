### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.

One copy of any of the five books costs $8.

If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.

If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.

Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.

Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.

For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

- 2 copies of the first book
- 2 copies of the second book
- 2 copies of the third book
- 1 copy of the fourth book
- 1 copy of the fifth book

One way of grouping these 8 books is:

- 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)
- 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

This would give a total of:

- 5 books at a 25% discount
- 3 books at a 10% discount

Resulting in:

- 5 × (100% - 25%) * $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus
- 3 × (100% - 10%) * $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60

Which equals $51.60.

However, a different way to group these 8 books is:

- 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)

This would give a total of:

- 4 books at a 20% discount
- 4 books at a 20% discount

Resulting in:

- 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus
- 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60

Which equals $51.20.

And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.

### Response:
To solve this problem we can start by creating a dictionary that maps each book to its quantity and then iterate over it to calculate the total cost after applying the discounts. We can create two lists for the discounts and their corresponding quantities, sort them in descending order based on the percentage value and apply them one by one until there are no more books left to apply the discounts. Here's an implementation of `total` function:
```python
def total(books):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each type of book
    book_count = {}
    for b in books:
        if b in book_count:
            book_count[b] += 1
        else:
            book_count[b] = 1

    
    # Define the discounts and their required quantities
    discounts = [(25, 5), (10, 4)]
    total_cost = 0
    remaining_books = sum(book_count.values())
    
    # Apply the discounts starting from the most beneficial ones
    for percent, qty in sorted(discounts, reverse=True):
        while remaining_books >= qty:
            total_cost += qty // qty * ((100 - percent)/100) * 8
            remaining_books -= qty
    
    # Calculate the cost of the remaining books without any discount
    total_cost += remaining_books * 8
    return round(total_cost)
```

We define the discounts as tuples containing the percentage and the number of books needed for the discount to be applied. Then we loop through them in reverse order (from highest to lowest) and check how many times we can apply the discount given the current quantity of books. For example, if we have 9 books and the discount requires 5 books, we can only apply it once.


The `while` loop continues until all the books are processed or there aren't enough books left to apply the discount. The expression `(qty // qty)` calculates the integer division between the number of books and the required quantity for the discount, which gives us the number of times we can apply the discount. Multiplying this result by the discounted price (`((100 - percent)/100 * 8`) and adding it to the total cost updates the total cost accordingly.


Finally, we add the cost of the remaining books without any discount and round the final result to avoid decimals.


Here's the complete code:
```python
def total(books):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each type of book
    book_count = {}
    for b in books:
        if b in book_count:
            book_count[b] += 1
        else:
            book_count[b] = 1
    
    # Define the discounts and their required quantities
    discounts = [(25, 5), (10, 4)]
    total_cost = 0
    remaining_books = sum(book_count.values())
    
    # Apply the discounts starting from the most beneficial ones
    for percent, qty in sorted(discounts, reverse=True):
        while remaining_books >= qty:
            total_cost += qty // qty * ((100 - percent)/100) * 8
            remaining_books -= qty
    
    # Calculate the cost of the remaining books without any discount
    total_cost += remaining_books * 8
    return round(total_cost)
```
