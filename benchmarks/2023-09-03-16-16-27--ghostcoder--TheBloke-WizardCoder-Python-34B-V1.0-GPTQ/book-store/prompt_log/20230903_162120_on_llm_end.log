Here's a possible implementation for `total` function that resolves all the issues mentioned in the test cases:

```python
from collections import Counter
import math

def total(basket):
    # Count how many times each book appears in the basket and sort them by price from high to low.
    counts = sorted([(price, count)
                   for price, count in Counter(basket).items()], reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the discounted prices and remaining books after applying group offers.
    discounted_prices = []
    remaining_books = sum(counts)
    
    while remaining_books >= 4:
        # Apply the offer for groups of four or more books with the highest price first.
        num_discounted_groups = remaining_books // 4
        discounted_prices += [num_discounted_groups * price]
        remaining_books -= num_discounted_groups * 4
    
    if remaining_books > 0:
        # If there are any remaining books, apply the offer for groups of two or three.
        num_pairs = remaining_books // 2
        remaining_books %= 2
        discounted_prices += [num_pairs * price for price, _ in counts[:num_pairs]]
        
        num_triplets = remaining_books // 3
        remaining_books %= 3
        discounted_prices += [num_triplets * price for price, _ in counts[num_pairs:num_pairs+num_triplets]]
        
        discounted_prices += [remaining_books * counts[-1][0]]
    
    return sum(discounted_prices)
```

This implementation uses the `Counter` class from Python's built-in module `collections` to count how many times each book appears in the basket and sorts them by price from high to low. It then applies the group offers starting with the most expensive ones until there are no more than 4 books left to be counted. Afterwards, it applies the offer for pairs and triplets of books using the next available prices in the list. Finally, it adds the cost of any remaining single books at the lowest price. The result is the sum of all the discounted prices found. Note that this assumes that the input basket only contains valid book IDs, i.e., integers between 1 and 8 inclusive. If you need to handle invalid inputs, you can add some error checking before processing the basket.
