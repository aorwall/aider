To solve this problem we can start by creating a dictionary that maps each book to its quantity and then iterate over it to calculate the total cost after applying the discounts. We can create two lists for the discounts and their corresponding quantities, sort them in descending order based on the percentage value and apply them one by one until there are no more books left to apply the discounts. Here's an implementation of `total` function:


```python
def total(books):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each type of book
    book_count = {}
    for b in books:
        if b in book_count:
            book_count[b] += 1
        else:
            book_count[b] = 1

    
    # Define the discounts and their required quantities
    discounts = [(25, 5), (10, 4)]
    total_cost = 0
    remaining_books = sum(book_count.values())
    
    # Apply the discounts starting from the most beneficial ones
    for percent, qty in sorted(discounts, reverse=True):
        while remaining_books >= qty:
            total_cost += qty // qty * ((100 - percent)/100) * 8
            remaining_books -= qty
    
    # Calculate the cost of the remaining books without any discount
    total_cost += remaining_books * 8
    return round(total_cost)
```

We define the discounts as tuples containing the percentage and the number of books needed for the discount to be applied. Then we loop through them in reverse order (from highest to lowest) and check how many times we can apply the discount given the current quantity of books. For example, if we have 9 books and the discount requires 5 books, we can only apply it once.


The `while` loop continues until all the books are processed or there aren't enough books left to apply the discount. The expression `(qty // qty)` calculates the integer division between the number of books and the required quantity for the discount, which gives us the number of times we can apply the discount. Multiplying this result by the discounted price (`((100 - percent)/100 * 8`) and adding it to the total cost updates the total cost accordingly.


Finally, we add the cost of the remaining books without any discount and round the final result to avoid decimals.


Here's the complete code:

```python
def total(books):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each type of book
    book_count = {}
    for b in books:
        if b in book_count:
            book_count[b] += 1
        else:
            book_count[b] = 1
    
    # Define the discounts and their required quantities
    discounts = [(25, 5), (10, 4)]
    total_cost = 0
    remaining_books = sum(book_count.values())
    
    # Apply the discounts starting from the most beneficial ones
    for percent, qty in sorted(discounts, reverse=True):
        while remaining_books >= qty:
            total_cost += qty // qty * ((100 - percent)/100) * 8
            remaining_books -= qty
    
    # Calculate the cost of the remaining books without any discount
    total_cost += remaining_books * 8
    return round(total_cost)
```
