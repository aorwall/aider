The expression `(qty // qty)` calculates the integer division between the number of books and the required quantity for the discount, which gives us the number of times we can apply the discount. Multiplying this result by the discounted price (`((100 - percent)/100 * 8`) and adding it to the total cost updates the total cost accordingly.\n\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the remaining books without any discount and round the final result to avoid decimals.\n\n\nHere's the complete code:",
