Here's an implementation of the `score()` function using the provided information about the target and its radii:

```python
import math

def score(x, y):
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    if distance > 10: # Outside the target
        return 0
    elif distance <= 10 and distance > 5: # Middle ring
        return 1
    elif distance <= 5 and distance > 1: # Inner ring
        return 5
    else: # Bullseye!
        return 10
```

We can calculate the distance between the center of the target and the point `(x, y)` using the Pythagorean theorem (`distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, since both x and y are measured from the center). Then we check which ring this distance falls into and return the corresponding number of points.

Note that we assume that the origin is located at (0, 0) as specified in the problem statement. Also note that we could have used other methods to determine whether a point lies inside a circle, such as checking if the distance is less than or equal to each radius separately, but the formula for calculating the distance is more concise and easier to read.
