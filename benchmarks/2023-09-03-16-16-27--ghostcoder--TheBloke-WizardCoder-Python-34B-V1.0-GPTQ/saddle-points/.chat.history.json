The largest value is 5.\n- Column 1 has values 9, 5, and 6. The smallest value is 5.\n\nSo the point at `[2, 1]` (row: 2, column: 1) is a great spot for a tree house.\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the `matrix` is irregular. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the matrix is irregular\nraise ValueError(\"irregular matrix\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: saddle_points.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

        "text": "The problem asks us to find all the saddle points in a given matrix. A saddle point is defined as a cell whose value is greater than or equal to its row maximum and less than or equal to its column minimum. We need to identify such cells in the matrix and return their coordinates as a list of tuples. If there are no saddle points, we should return an empty list.\n\n\nWe can solve this problem by iterating through each element in the matrix and checking whether it satisfies the condition mentioned above. To check if it is a saddle point, we need to compare it with the maximum value in its row and minimum value in its column. We can get the maximum value in a row using the max() function on the corresponding row and the minimum value in a column using min(). However, before doing so, we need to make sure that the input matrix is valid i.e., it must have same number of elements in each row and column. Otherwise, we cannot determine the correct row and column indices.\n\n\nLet's start by writing some test cases to validate our solution.<|im_sep|>",
