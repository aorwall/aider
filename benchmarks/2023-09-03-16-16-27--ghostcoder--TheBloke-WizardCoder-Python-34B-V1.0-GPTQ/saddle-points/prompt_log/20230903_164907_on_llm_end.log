prompt:
The problem asks us to find all the saddle points in a given matrix. A saddle point is defined as a cell whose value is greater than or equal to its row maximum and less than or equal to its column minimum. We need to identify such cells in the matrix and return their coordinates as a list of tuples. If there are no saddle points, we should return an empty list.


We can solve this problem by iterating through each element in the matrix and checking whether it satisfies the condition mentioned above. To check if it is a saddle point, we need to compare it with the maximum value in its row and minimum value in its column. We can get the maximum value in a row using the max() function on the corresponding row and the minimum value in a column using min(). However, before doing so, we need to make sure that the input matrix is valid i.e., it must have same number of elements in each row and column. Otherwise, we cannot determine the correct row and column indices.


Let's start by writing some test cases to validate our solution.<|im_sep|>
