Here's an implementation for the given requirements:

```python
import datetime

class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour=None, minute=None):
        self._hour = None
        self._minute = None
        
        # If both arguments are provided, set them directly.
        if hour is not None and minute is not None:
            self._set_time(hour, minute)
        else:
            now = datetime.datetime.now()
            self._set_time(now.hour, now.minute)

    
    def _set_time(self, hour, minute):
        """Set the time using hours and minutes."""
        self._hour = (hour + 24) % 24
        self._minute = (minute + 60) % 60
    
    @property
    def hour(self):
        return self._hour
    
    @property
    def minute(self):
        return self._minute
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.hour}, {self.minute})"
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.hour}:{self.minute}"
    
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.hour == other.hour and self.minute == other.minute
    
    def __add__(self, minutes):
        total_mins = self.minute + minutes
        extra_hours = int(total_mins / 60)
        new_hour = (self.hour + extra_hours) % 24
        new_minutes = total_mins % 60
        return Clock(new_hour, new_minutes)
    
    def __sub__(self, minutes):
        total_mins = self.minute - minutes
        while total_mins < 0:
            total_mins += 60
            self._hour -= 1
        new_hour = (self.hour - 1) % 24
        return Clock(new_hour, total_mins)
```

Explanation:

- We initialize `_hour` and `_minute` attributes with `None`, so we can check later whether they have been initialized or not.
- In the constructor, we first check if both `hour` and `minute` are provided. If yes, then we set them directly using `_set_time()`. Otherwise, we get the current system time using `datetime.datetime.now()` and extract the hour and minute components.
- The `_set_time()` method sets the time by taking care of overflowing values. For example, if `hour` is greater than 23, we add 24 and take modulo 24 to get the correct value. Similarly, if `minute` is greater than 59, we add 60 and take modulo 60 to get the correct value.
- We define properties `hour` and `minute` to access the private attributes `_hour` and `_minute` respectively.
- The `__repr__()` method returns a string representing the class name and the hour and minute values.
- The `__str__()` method returns a string representing the time in HH:MM format.
- The `__eq__()` method compares the `hour` and `minute` attributes of two instances of `Clock` class.
- The `__add__()` method adds the given number of minutes to the instance's time and creates a new `Clock` object with updated values. It calculates the number of extra hours and adjusts the `hour` attribute accordingly.
- The `__sub__()` method subtracts the given number of minutes from the instance's time and creates a new `Clock` object with updated values. If the resultant minutes are negative, we decrement the `hour` attribute by 1 and make up for the difference in minutes.

Note: I haven't implemented the `is_valid()` method because it was not mentioned in the requirements. However, it should be easy to do so based on the given conditions.
