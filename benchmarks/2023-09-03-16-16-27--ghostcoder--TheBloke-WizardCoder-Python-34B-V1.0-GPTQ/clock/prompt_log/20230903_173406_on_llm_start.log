### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your clock will be implemented via a Clock `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.
## Representing your class

When working with and debugging objects, it's important to have a string representation of that object.
For example, if you were to create a new `datetime.datetime` object in the Python [REPL][REPL] environment, you could see its string representation:

```python
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> new_date = datetime(2022, 5, 4)
>>> new_date
datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4, 0, 0)
```

Your Clock `class` will create a custom `object` that handles times without dates.
One important aspect of this `class` will be how it is represented as a _string_.
Other programmers who use or call Clock `objects` created from the Clock `class` will refer to this string representation for debugging and other activities.  
However, the default string representation on a `class` is usually not very helpful.

```python
>>> Clock(12, 34)
<Clock object st 0x102807b20 >
```

To create a more helpful representation, you can define a `__repr__` method on the `class` that returns a string.

Ideally, the `__repr__` method returns valid Python code that can be used to recreate the object -- as laid out in the [specification for a `__repr__` method][repr-docs].
Returning valid Python code allows you to copy-paste the `str` directly into code or the REPL.

For example, a `Clock` that represents 11:30 AM could look like this: `Clock(11, 30)`.

Defining a `__repr__` method is good practice for all classes.
Some things to consider:

- The information returned from this method should be beneficial when debugging issues.
- _Ideally_, the method returns a string that is valid Python code -- although that might not always be possible.
- If valid Python code is not practical, returning a description between angle brackets: `< ...a practical description... >` is the convention.


### String conversion

In addition to the `__repr__` method, there might also be a need for an alternative "human-readable" string representation of the `class`.
This might be used to format the object for program output or documentation.
Looking at `datetime.datetime` again:

```python
>>> str(datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4))
'2022-05-04 00:00:00'
```

When a `datetime` object is asked to convert itself to a string representation, it returns a `str` formatted according to the [ISO 8601 standard][ISO 8601], which can be parsed by most datetime libraries into a human-readable date and time.

In this exercise, you will get a chance to write a `__str__` method, as well as a `__repr__`.

```python
>>> str(Clock(11, 30))
'11:30'
```

To support this string conversion, you will need to create a `__str__` method on your class that returns a more "human readable" string showing the Clock time.

If you don't create a `__str__` method and you call `str()` on your class, python will try calling `__repr__` on your class as a fallback. So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.

### Response:
Here's an implementation for the given requirements:
Filepath: clock.py
```
import datetime

class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour=None, minute=None):
        self._hour = None
        self._minute = None

        # If both arguments are provided, set them directly.
        if hour is not None and minute is not None:
            self._set_time(hour, minute)
        else:
            now = datetime.datetime.now()
            self._set_time(now.hour, now.minute)


    def _set_time(self, hour, minute):
        """Set the time using hours and minutes."""
        self._hour = (hour + 24) % 24
        self._minute = (minute + 60) % 60

    @property
    def hour(self):
        return self._hour

    @property
    def minute(self):
        return self._minute

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.hour}, {self.minute})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.hour}:{self.minute}"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.hour == other.hour and self.minute == other.minute

    def __add__(self, minutes):
        total_mins = self.minute + minutes
        extra_hours = int(total_mins / 60)
        new_hour = (self.hour + extra_hours) % 24
        new_minutes = total_mins % 60
        return Clock(new_hour, new_minutes)

    def __sub__(self, minutes):
        total_mins = self.minute - minutes
        while total_mins < 0:
            total_mins += 60
            self._hour -= 1
        new_hour = (self.hour - 1) % 24
        return Clock(new_hour, total_mins)

```

Explanation:

- We initialize `_hour` and `_minute` attributes with `None`, so we can check later whether they have been initialized or not.
- In the constructor, we first check if both `hour` and `minute` are provided. If yes, then we set them directly using `_set_time()`. Otherwise, we get the current system time using `datetime.datetime.now()` and extract the hour and minute components.
- The `_set_time()` method sets the time by taking care of overflowing values. For example, if `hour` is greater than 23, we add 24 and take modulo 24 to get the correct value. Similarly, if `minute` is greater than 59, we add 60 and take modulo 60 to get the correct value.
- We define properties `hour` and `minute` to access the private attributes `_hour` and `_minute` respectively.
- The `__repr__()` method returns a string representing the class name and the hour and minute values.
- The `__str__()` method returns a string representing the time in HH:MM format.
- The `__eq__()` method compares the `hour` and `minute` attributes of two instances of `Clock` class.
- The `__add__()` method adds the given number of minutes to the instance's time and creates a new `Clock` object with updated values. It calculates the number of extra hours and adjusts the `hour` attribute accordingly.
- The `__sub__()` method subtracts the given number of minutes from the instance's time and creates a new `Clock` object with updated values. If the resultant minutes are negative, we decrement the `hour` attribute by 1 and make up for the difference in minutes.

Note: I haven't implemented the `is_valid()` method because it was not mentioned in the requirements. However, it should be easy to do so based on the given conditions.
