Here's a possible implementation for `add` function that should fix all the failing tests:

```python
from datetime import timedelta
import re

def add(moment):
    match = re.match("^(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})T(\d{2}):(\d{2}:)(\d{2})$", moment)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid date format")
    year, month, day, hour, minute, second = map(int, match.groups())
    return (datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) + 
            timedelta(seconds=1e9))
```

This implementation uses regular expressions to parse the input string and extract its components, then creates a new `datetime` object with those values plus one billion seconds added to it using the `timedelta` class from Python's standard library.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input is always in the format of `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`, so you may need to modify it if your requirements differ. Also note that it doesn't handle leap years or other calendar-related issues, but since we don't have any information about them in the prompt, I assumed they were out of scope for this exercise.
