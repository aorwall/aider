        "text": "# Introduction\n\nThe way we measure time is kind of messy.\nWe have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.\nThis comes from ancient Babylon, where they used 60 as the basis for their number system.\nWe have 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, and how many days in a month?\nWell, for days in a month it depends not only on which month it is, but also on what type of calendar is used in the country you live in.\n\nWhat if, instead, we only use seconds to express time intervals?\nThen we can use metric system prefixes for writing large numbers of seconds in more easily comprehensible quantities.\n\n- A food recipe might explain that you need to let the brownies cook in the oven for two kiloseconds (that's two thousand seconds).\n- Perhaps you and your family would travel to somewhere exotic for two megaseconds (that's two million seconds).\n- And if you and your spouse were married for _a thousand million_ seconds, you would celebrate your one gigasecond anniversary.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nIf we ever colonize Mars or some other planet, measuring time is going to get even messier.\nIf someone says \"year\" do they mean a year on Earth or a year on Mars?\n\nThe idea for this exercise came from the science fiction novel [\"A Deepness in the Sky\"][vinge-novel] by author Vernor Vinge.\nIn it the author uses the metric system as the basis for time measurements.\n\n[vinge-novel]: https://www.tor.com/2017/08/03/science-fiction-with-something-for-everyone-a-deepness-in-the-sky-by-vernor-vinge/\n~~~~\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to determine the date and time one gigasecond after a certain date.\n\nA gigasecond is one thousand million seconds.\nThat is a one with nine zeros after it.\n\nIf you were born on _January 24th, 2015 at 22:00 (10:00:00pm)_, then you would be a gigasecond old on _October 2nd, 2046 at 23:46:40 (11:46:40pm)_.\n# Instructions append\n\n## Reading and Writing Long Numbers\n\nCode is more often _read_ than it is written, and reading a big/long number within other text can be a challenge.\nHere are two approaches to making numbers more readable:\n\n1. Using underscores in Numeric Literals. `1_000_000` is more readable than `1000000`, and `10_100_201_330` is easier to scan than `10100201330`. For more information, see [PEP-0515][underscores_notation].\n\n2. Using exponential notation or scientific notation. The e (or E) character followed by an integer represents the power of 10 by which the number preceding the e should be multiplied (_**ie:** `1e6`, 1 is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of 6, which equals `1000000`_). For more details, check out this reference on [scientific notation][scientific_notation].\n\n\n## Dates and Times in Python\n\nThis exercise explores objects from Python's `datetime` module:\n\n- [Official Python documentation on the datetime module][datetime]\n- [datetime objects][datetime.datetime]\n- [timedelta objects][datetime.timedelta]\n\n[datetime.datetime]: https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime\n[datetime.timedelta]: https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects\n[datetime]: https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/datetime.html#module-datetime\n[scientific_notation]: https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/float/scientific.html\n[underscores_notation]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0515/#:~:text=The%20syntax%20would%20be%20the,width%20of%2010%20with%20*%20separator.\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: gigasecond.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
