When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n\nCustom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n\nFor situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n\nTo customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\nclass MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n\n    message: explanation of the error.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n        \n# raising a MeetupDayException\nraise MeetupDayException(\"That day does not exist.\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
