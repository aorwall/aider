There are two syntax errors in the code:

1. Missing closing parenthesis for `datetime.date` function call on line 36.
2. Indentation issue on lines 38 and 39.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
import calendar
from datetime import date

def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
    try:
        weekday_number = days.index(day_of_week.title()) + 1 # get index of day of week (0 based) and add 1 since Monday is 1
    except ValueError:
        raise MeetupDayException()

    if week < 1 or week > 5:
        raise MeetupDayException("Week must be between 1 and 5")

    num_days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]
    if week == 5:
        return datetime.date(year, month, num_days - ((num_days % 7) + 2))
    elif week == 1:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number)
    else:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number + (week-1)*7 + (weekday_number <= 4))
```

I added the missing closing parenthesis for `datetime.date()` function call on line 36 and fixed indentation issues by aligning it with previous lines.
