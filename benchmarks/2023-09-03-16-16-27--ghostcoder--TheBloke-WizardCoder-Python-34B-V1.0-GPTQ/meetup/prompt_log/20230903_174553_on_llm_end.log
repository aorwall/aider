Here's the modified code with the required changes:

```python
import datetime

# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.
    
    message: explanation of the error.
    
    """
    def __init__(self, message="Invalid weekday or count provided."):
        super().__init__(message)


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
    try:
        weekday_number = days.index(day_of_week.title()) + 1 # get index of day of week (0 based) and add 1 since Monday is 1
    except ValueError:
        raise MeetupDayException()
    
    if week == 5:
        return max_date = datetime.datetime(year, month, calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]) - datetime.timedelta(days=7)
    else:
        first_weekday = datetime.datetime(year, month, 1).isoweekday() # get the ISO weekday of the first day of the month (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday)
        if first_weekday > weekday_number:
            first_weekday -= 7
        return datetime.date(year, month, week * 7 + weekday_number - first_weekday + 1 - 7*(week-1))
```

In this implementation, we added a check to see if the input `day_of_week` exists in our list of `days`. If it doesn't, we raise a `MeetupDayException` with an appropriate error message. We also changed the calculation of `max_date` to subtract 7 days instead of adding them, which was incorrect before. This ensures that the last Friday of the month is returned even if there are less than 4 Fridays in the month. Finally, we used `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` to determine the number of days in the month, so that we can calculate the correct date for the fifth week. Note that we imported the `calendar` module at the beginning of the file. Here's the complete code:

```python
import calendar

# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.
    
    message: explanation of the error.
    
    """
    def __init__(self, message="Invalid weekday or count provided."):
        super().__init__(message)


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
    try:
        weekday_number = days.index(day_of_week.title()) + 1 # get index of day of week (0 based) and add 1 since Monday is 1
    except ValueError:
        raise MeetupDayException()
    
    if week < 1 or week > 5:
        raise MeetupDayException("Week must be between 1 and 5")
    
    num_days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]
    if week == 5:
        return datetime.date(year, month, num_days - ((num_days % 7) + 2)
    elif week == 1:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number)
    else:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number + (week-1)*7 + (weekday_number <= 4))
```

We added another condition to check if the `week` value is outside the range of 1 to 5, and raised a `MeetupDayException` with an appropriate message. For weeks other than the fifth week, we adjusted the calculation of the date accordingly using `(weekday_number <= 4)`. This takes care of cases where the desired weekday falls on the last week of the month and needs to be moved back by a week.
