The first error in the code is that there's a missing closing parenthesis at the end of line 36. It should be:

```python
return max_date = datetime.datetime(year, month, calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]).replace(day=calendar.monthrange(year, month)[0])
```


The second error is a typo in the function definition for `meetup_day`. The parameter `max_date` is not used anywhere inside the function body. We can remove it from the argument list.


Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
import datetime
import calendar
from typing import Union

class MeetupDayException(Exception):
    pass

def meetup_day(year: int, month: int, day_of_week: str, week: int) -> datetime.date:
    """Returns the date of a meetup given year, month, day of week and week number."""
    days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
    try:
        weekday_number = days.index(day_of_week.title()) + 1 # get index of day of week (0 based)
    except ValueError:
        raise MeetupDayException()
    
    if week < 1 or week > 5:
        raise MeetupDayException("Week must be between 1 and 5")
    
    num_days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]
    if week == 5:
        return datetime.date(year, month, num_days - ((num_days % 7) + 2))
    elif week == 1:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number)
    else:
        return datetime.date(year, month, weekday_number + (week-1)*7 + (weekday_number <= 4))
```

Note that I removed the unnecessary assignment statement `max_date =`, as well as the trailing parentheses after `num_days - ((num_days % 7) + 2)` on line 36.
