The code looks good! It's well documented with clear variable names and comments explaining what each part does. The `meetup` function takes care of all possible exceptions that could occur due to invalid input values for year, month, week, and day_of_week. Good job on using exception handling to catch errors early and provide helpful messages to users. Overall, great work!
