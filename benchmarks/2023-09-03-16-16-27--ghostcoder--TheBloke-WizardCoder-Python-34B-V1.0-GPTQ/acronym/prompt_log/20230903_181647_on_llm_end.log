Here is a possible solution for `acronym.py`:

```python
import re

def abbreviate(phrase):
    words = phrase.split()
    # Remove any non-word characters and split by upper case letters or underscores.
    # This will create a list of all capitalized words and their initialisms.
    words = re.findall('[A-Z][a-z]*|[A-Z]+(?![a-z])|[^A-Z\s]+', phrase)
    
    # Create an empty string to store the acronym.
    acronym = ""
    
    # Iterate over each word and add its first letter to the acronym if it is capitalized.
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 0 and word[0].isupper():
            acronym += word[0]
    
    return acronym.upper()
```

This implementation uses regular expressions (`re`) to extract all capitalized words and their initialisms from the input phrase. It then iterates through these words and adds their first letter to the acronym if they are capitalized. The resulting acronym is returned as an uppercase string.
