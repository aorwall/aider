Solution:
We can count the number of rectangles in the ASCII diagram using pattern matching.

A rectangle consists of four sides where all four sides have the same length and all corners are connected. We can identify rectangles by finding patterns of '+' characters surrounded by '-' characters on both top and bottom edges and left and right edges.


To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each character in the string and check whether there exists a rectangle starting at that position. If yes, we increment the counter and move to the next row until we reach the end of the string. 


Here's how we can do it step by step:


1. Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the number of rectangles found so far.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. For each character, check if it is a '+'. If it is, find the width and height of the possible rectangle by checking the adjacent characters in the same column and row respectively.
4. Check if the current character has a complete set of horizontal and vertical borders around it. A complete set of horizontal border means two consecutive lines contain only '-' characters before and after the '+', while a complete set of vertical border means two consecutive columns contain only '|' characters above and below the '+'.
5. If both horizontal and vertical borders exist, we have found a rectangle. Increment the counter and continue searching for more rectangles in the remaining part of the string.
6. Return the total count of rectangles found.


Let's write the implementation.<|im_sep|>
