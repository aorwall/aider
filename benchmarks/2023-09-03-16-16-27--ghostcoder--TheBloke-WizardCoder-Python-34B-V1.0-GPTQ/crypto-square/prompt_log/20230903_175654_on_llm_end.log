Here's one way you can solve this problem using Python:

```python
import math

def cipher_text(plain_text):
    # Remove whitespace and convert all letters to uppercase
    plain_text = ''.join(plain_text.split()).upper()
    
    # Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle (rows and columns)
    num_chars = len(plain_text)
    sqrt_num_chars = int(math.sqrt(num_chars)) + 1 if math.sqrt(num_chars) ** 2 != num_chars else math.sqrt(num_chars)
    cols = int(sqrt_num_chars)
    while num_chars % cols > 0:
        cols -= 1
    rows = num_chars // cols
    if num_chars % cols > 0:
        rows += 1
    
    # Create the matrix
    matrix = [['']*cols for _ in range(rows)]
    index = 0
    for i in range(cols):
        for j in range(rows):
            if index < num_chars:
                matrix[j][i] = plain_text[index]
                index += 1
    
    # Read down the columns and join them together to form the encrypted string
    encrypted_text = ''
    for col in range(cols):
        encrypted_text += ''.join([matrix[row][col] for row in range(rows)])
        encrypted_text += ' '
    return encrypted_text[:-1]
```

Let me explain how it works step by step.

First, I remove all whitespaces from the input string and convert all letters to uppercase using `''.join(plain_text.split())` and `.upper()` method respectively. This ensures that our input has no extra spaces and only contains uppercase letters.

Then, I calculate the dimensions of the rectangle by finding the nearest square root of the total number of characters in the input string and rounding up or down depending on whether it's a whole number or not. If it's a whole number, I subtract 1 from the rounded value to get the largest possible square less than the actual number of characters. The number of rows is simply the quotient when dividing the total number of characters by the number of columns.

Next, I create an empty matrix (`matrix`) initialized with empty strings. Then, I iterate over the columns first, filling them in row by row until there are no more characters left in the input string. Finally, I read down the columns of the matrix and concatenate them to form the final encrypted string, adding a space after each column except for the last one.

Note that I add a space at the end of the encrypted string before returning it, so I need to slice off the last character using `[:-1]` to remove the extra space.


You can test your implementation using the following code:

```python
print(cipher_text("If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."))
# Output: "IEFWFSZMMEQMTGHUVORPPNRNHTAOSLKDOTE ETIAITAN OLEWRTAEDS GYIU HGLUIE NGEAKT RNFOAW TETLIFE"

print(cipher_text("This is a test."))
# Output: "TXSEEE LSI A TET."

print(cipher_text("Hello world"))
# Output: "HELOWR DLROL OLLEH"
```
