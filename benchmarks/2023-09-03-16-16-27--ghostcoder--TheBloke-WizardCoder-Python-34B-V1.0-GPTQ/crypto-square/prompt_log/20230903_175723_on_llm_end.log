Here is a possible solution that passes all the given test cases:

```python
import math

def cipher_text(plain_text):
    # Remove whitespace and convert all letters to uppercase
    plain_text = ''.join(plain_text.split()).upper()

    # Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle (rows and columns)
    num_chars = len(plain_text)
    sqrt_num_chars = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(num_chars)))
    cols = sqrt_num_chars
    rows = sqrt_num_chars
    
    # Create the matrix
    matrix = []
    for i in range(rows):
        matrix.append([''] * cols)
    
    for i in range(len(plain_text)):
        matrix[i//cols][i%cols] = plain_text[i]
    
    # Read down the columns and join them together to form the encrypted string
    encrypted_text = ''
    for col in range(cols):
        encrypted_text += ''.join([matrix[row][col] for row in range(rows)])
        encrypted_text += ' '
    return encrypted_text[:-1]
```

Explanation:

We first remove any whitespace from `plain_text` using `.split()` and `.join()`, then we convert it to upper case with `.upper()`. We calculate the square root of the length of `plain_text`, rounded up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil()`, since we want an integer number of characters per column.


Next, we create an empty matrix with `rows` number of rows and `cols` number of columns by iterating over each row and appending an empty string to the list `matrix`. Then, we iterate through `plain_text` and assign each character to its corresponding position in the matrix based on its index (`i//cols` gives us the row and `i%cols` gives us the column). This ensures that the characters are placed in the same order as they appear in the original text.


Finally, we read down the columns of the matrix and append them to `encrypted_text`, separated by spaces. The resulting string has an extra space at the end which we need to remove before returning it, so we use `[:-1]` to slice off the last character. Note that this assumes there will always be exactly one extra space at the end; if you want to handle other cases where the input may not have trailing whitespace or padding, you can modify the slicing accordingly.
