Explanation:

We have created a new class `PascalTriangle` which takes in the number of rows required as input.
Inside the `__init__` method we initialize the instance variable `row_count`. We then define a property `triangle` which generates the triangle using `_generate_pascal_triangle()`. This method uses a generator to generate each row of the triangle recursively.


In the `_generate_pascal_triangle()` method, we start with a single element `[1]` and append it to the result list. Then, we iterate over all the remaining rows up to `n`, generating them using the formula `(previous row at index j) + (previous row at index j-1)`. The first and last elements are always 1, so we add those manually before appending the rest of the row.


In the `rows()` function, we check whether the input is valid or not. If it's less than zero, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message. Otherwise, we create an object of `PascalTriangle` and return its `triangle` property converted into a list.
