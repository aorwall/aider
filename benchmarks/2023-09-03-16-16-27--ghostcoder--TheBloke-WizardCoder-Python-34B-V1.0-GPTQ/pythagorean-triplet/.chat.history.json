We can generate such triplets by iterating over values of `a` from 1 to `n//3 - 1`, where `n` is the given number. For each value of `a`, we find the corresponding value of `b` using the formula `b = sqrt(n^2 - a^2)`. This ensures that `a < b < n - a` and `a^2 + b^2 <= n^2`. Then, we calculate `c = n - a - b` which will be an integer since `a + b + c = n`. If `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, then we add `[a, b, c]` to our list of results.\n\nNote that we don't need to check whether `c` is an integer because it must always be an integer when `a` and `b` are integers. Also, we only iterate up to `n//3 - 1` instead of `n - 1` because any larger value of `a` would make `b` too small to form a valid triplet with `c`. Finally, we sort the resulting list before returning it as required by the problem statement.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
