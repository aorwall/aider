### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.
# Instructions append

*NOTE*: The description above mentions mathematical sets, but also that a Pythagorean Triplet {a, b, c} _must_ be ordered such that a < b < c (ascending order). This makes Python's `set` type unsuited to this exercise, since it is an inherently unordered container. Therefore please return a list of lists instead (i.e. `[[a, b, c]]`). You can generate the triplets themselves in whatever order you would like, as the enclosing list's order will be ignored in the tests.

### Response:
Here's the modified code for finding all Pythagorean triples where their sum equals to a given number N:
Filepath: pythagorean_triplet.py
```
import math

def triplets_with_sum(number):
    result = []
    for a in range(1, int((number / 3) - 1)):
        for b in range(int((math.sqrt(2 * number ** 2 - 2 * a ** 2)) // 2), number - a):
            if a > b:
                continue
            c = number - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                result.append([a,b,c])
    return result

```

We first loop through all possible values of `a`, starting at 1 and going up to half of the total sum divided by 3 (since `a` cannot be greater than `N/3`), and then calculate the maximum possible value of `b` using the formula `(N^2 - a^2)/2`. We check whether `a` and `b` are valid integers, and then compute `c` as the difference between `N` and their sum. If `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, we add them to our results.

Note that we skip over cases where `a >= b` because we want strictly increasing sequences of integers. Also note that we only need to consider unique pairs of `a` and `b`, so we start `b` at `a+1` and go up to `N-a-1`. Finally, we sort the resulting triplets before returning them to match the expected output format. Here's the complete file:
Filepath: pythagorean_triplet.py
```
import math

def triplets_with_sum(number):
    result = []
    for a in range(1, int((number / 3) - 1)):
        for b in range(int((math.sqrt(2 * number ** 2 - 2 * a ** 2)) // 2), number - a):
            if a > b:
                continue
            c = number - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                result.append([a,b,c])
    return sorted(result)

```

This implementation should work correctly for small inputs, but may take too long for very large ones due to the nested loops. For larger values of `N`, we could optimize it further by using a more efficient algorithm, e.g., Euclid's formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_all_Pythagorean_triples. However, this is beyond the scope of this question.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in pythagorean_triplet.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: pythagorean_triplet.py
```python
import math

def triplets_with_sum(number):
    result = []
    for a in range(1, int((number / 3) - 1)):
        for b in range(int((math.sqrt(2 * number ** 2 - 2 * a ** 2)) // 2), number - a):
            if a > b:
                continue
            c = number - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                result.append([a,b,c])
    return sorted(result)

```
