### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.

To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

- to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
- to list the different band colors

Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:
Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.

More information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].

### Response:
Here's one possible implementation for `colors()` and `color_code()` functions:
Filepath: resistor_color.py
```
def color_code(band_color):
    """Return the numerical value of a given color."""
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    try:
        return color_codes[band_color]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid color")
def color_code(color):
    pass


def colors():
    """List all available colors."""
    return list(color_codes.keys())

```

Explanation:

We define a dictionary `color_codes` which contains the mapping between color names (as strings) and their corresponding numerical values.
Then we define the `color_code()` function which takes a string parameter representing a color name and returns its numerical value by looking it up in the dictionary. If the color is invalid (i.e., not present in the keys), we raise a `ValueError`. Finally, we define the `colors()` function which simply returns the list of valid color names by calling `.keys()` method on the `color_codes` dictionary.


Note that we could also use a list instead of a dictionary here, but since we only need to access the values through their keys, a dictionary provides better performance and clarity. Also note that we assume that the input color names are always lowercase and match exactly the keys in the dictionary. We could add some error handling to convert the input to lower case and check if it exists in the dictionary before returning its value.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in resistor_color.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: resistor_color.py
```python
def color_code(band_color):
    """Return the numerical value of a given color."""
    color_codes = {
