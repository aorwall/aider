Here's one possible implementation for `colors()` and `color_code()` functions:

```python
def color_code(band_color):
    """Return the numerical value of a given color."""
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }
    try:
        return color_codes[band_color]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid color")


def colors():
    """List all available colors."""
    return list(color_codes.keys())
```

Explanation:

We define a dictionary `color_codes` which contains the mapping between color names (as strings) and their corresponding numerical values.
Then we define the `color_code()` function which takes a string parameter representing a color name and returns its numerical value by looking it up in the dictionary. If the color is invalid (i.e., not present in the keys), we raise a `ValueError`. Finally, we define the `colors()` function which simply returns the list of valid color names by calling `.keys()` method on the `color_codes` dictionary.


Note that we could also use a list instead of a dictionary here, but since we only need to access the values through their keys, a dictionary provides better performance and clarity. Also note that we assume that the input color names are always lowercase and match exactly the keys in the dictionary. We could add some error handling to convert the input to lower case and check if it exists in the dictionary before returning its value.
