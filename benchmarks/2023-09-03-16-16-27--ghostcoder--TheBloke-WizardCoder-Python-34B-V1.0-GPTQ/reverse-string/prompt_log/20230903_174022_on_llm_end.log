Solution:
We can simply iterate over the input string using a loop and concatenate the characters in reverse order to get the reversed string.

Here's how we can do this:

```python
def reverse(text):
    # Initialize empty string to store the reversed text
    rev_str = ""
    
    # Iterate over the input string backwards and append each character to the output string
    for char in text[::-1]:
        rev_str += char
    
    # Return the reversed string
    return rev_str
```

This solution has O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input string since we need to iterate over every character once. We can also achieve the same functionality using slicing but it would require creating a new string which may not be efficient for large strings. Hence, iterating over the string is preferred.
