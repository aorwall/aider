Here's an implementation of the `to_rna()` function using string manipulation:

```python
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    """
    Transcribes a DNA strand into its corresponding RNA strand.
    
    Args:
      dna_strand (str): A string representing a DNA strand.
    Returns:
      The RNA strand obtained by replacing each nucleotide in the input DNA strand with its complementary nucleotide.
    """
    mapping = {'G': 'C', 'C': 'G', 'T': 'A', 'A': 'U'}
    rna_strand = ''
    for nucleotide in dna_strand:
        if nucleotide in mapping:
            rna_strand += mapping[nucleotide]
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid DNA strand')
    return rna_strand
```

We define a dictionary `mapping` which maps each nucleotide in the DNA strand to its complementary nucleotide in RNA. Then we iterate over each character in the input `dna_strand`, check if it exists as a key in the `mapping` dictionary, and append its value to the output `rna_strand`. If the nucleotide does not exist in the `mapping` dictionary, we raise a `ValueError` since it means the input contains invalid characters.


Note that this implementation assumes that the input `dna_strand` only consists of valid DNA nucleotides (`G`, `C`, `T`, `A`). If there could be other characters present, such as whitespace or newlines, we would need to add additional error handling code.
