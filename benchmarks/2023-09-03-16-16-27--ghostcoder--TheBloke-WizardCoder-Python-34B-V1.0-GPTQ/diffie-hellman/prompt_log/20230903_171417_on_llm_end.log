Here's one possible implementation using the `random` module:

```python
import random

def private_key(p):
    """Return a randomly chosen integer between 2 and p - 1"""
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)


def public_key(p, g, private):
    """Calculate the public key given a private key and base g"""
    return pow(g, private, p)


def secret(p, public, private):
    """Calculate the shared secret key given both parties' private keys"""
    return pow(public, private, p)
```

Note that we can simplify the calculation of the shared secret by taking advantage of the fact that
the order of operands doesn't matter when doing exponentiation (`a^b == b^a`). Therefore,
we can calculate either `public^private` or `private^public`, since `(a^b)^c = a^(bc)` (where c=g).
We choose to do `public^private` here.

To make sure that the output is always an integer, we need to specify the third argument to `pow()` as `p`. This ensures that the result is taken modulo `p`. If we didn't do this, the result could be a float, which might cause unexpected behavior downstream.
