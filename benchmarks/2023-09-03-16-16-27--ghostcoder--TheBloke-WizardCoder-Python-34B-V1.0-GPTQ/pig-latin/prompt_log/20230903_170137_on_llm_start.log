### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.
It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.

- **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
  Please note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay").
- **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
  Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, such as the "ch" in "chair" or "st" in "stand" (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").
- **Rule 3**: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay").
- **Rule 4**: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word it makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").

There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.
Check the tests for all the details.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig_latin.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's one possible implementation of `translate` using regular expressions:
Filepath: pig_latin.py
```
import re

VOWELS = 'aeiouAEIOU'
CONSONANTS = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated = []

    for word in words:
        if len(word) == 0:
            continue # skip empty strings
        elif word[0] in VOWELS:
            translated.append(word + 'ay')
        elif word[:2].lower() == 'qu':
            translated.append(word[2:] + word[:2] + 'ay')
        else:
            match = re.match('(['+CONSONANTS]+|xr|yt', word)
            if match:
                prefix = match.group()
                suffix = word[len(prefix):]
                translated.append(suffix + prefix + 'ay')
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid input")

    return ' '.join(translated)

```

This implementation splits the input string into individual words, processes each word separately, and joins them back together afterwards.
The first conditional handles the case where the word starts with a vowel sound, while the second handles the case where it starts with a consonant cluster followed by "qu".
Finally, the third conditional handles the general case where the word starts with a consonant cluster.
Note that this implementation assumes that the input only consists of alphabetic characters and whitespace; other characters may cause errors.
Also note that this implementation does not handle some edge cases mentioned in the Wikipedia article, such as capitalization or punctuation.
If you need to handle those cases, you could modify the code accordingly.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in pig_latin.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: pig_latin.py
```python
import re

VOWELS = 'aeiouAEIOU'
CONSONANTS = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated = []

    for word in words:

        elif word[0] in VOWELS:
            translated.append(word + 'ay')
        elif word[:2].lower() == 'qu':

    return ' '.join(translated)
