Here's one possible implementation of `translate` using regular expressions:

```python
import re

VOWELS = 'aeiouAEIOU'
CONSONANTS = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated = []
    
    for word in words:
        if len(word) == 0:
            continue # skip empty strings
        elif word[0] in VOWELS:
            translated.append(word + 'ay')
        elif word[:2].lower() == 'qu':
            translated.append(word[2:] + word[:2] + 'ay')
        else:
            match = re.match('(['+CONSONANTS]+|xr|yt', word)
            if match:
                prefix = match.group()
                suffix = word[len(prefix):]
                translated.append(suffix + prefix + 'ay')
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    
    return ' '.join(translated)
```

This implementation splits the input string into individual words, processes each word separately, and joins them back together afterwards.
The first conditional handles the case where the word starts with a vowel sound, while the second handles the case where it starts with a consonant cluster followed by "qu".
Finally, the third conditional handles the general case where the word starts with a consonant cluster.
Note that this implementation assumes that the input only consists of alphabetic characters and whitespace; other characters may cause errors.
Also note that this implementation does not handle some edge cases mentioned in the Wikipedia article, such as capitalization or punctuation.
If you need to handle those cases, you could modify the code accordingly.
