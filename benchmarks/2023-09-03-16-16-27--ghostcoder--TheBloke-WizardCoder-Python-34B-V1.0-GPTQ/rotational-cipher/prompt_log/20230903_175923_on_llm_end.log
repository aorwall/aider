Here's one way you could implement the `rotate()` function:

```python
def rotate(text, key):
    # Convert text to lowercase so we only have to handle one case
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Create a dictionary mapping each letter to its corresponding rotated letter based on the given key
    rotation_dict = {}
    for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + key) % 26 + ord('a'))
        rotation_dict[char] = new_char if new_char <= 'z' else new_char - 26
    
    # Rotate each character in the text by replacing them with their mapped value in the dictionary
    rotated_text = ''
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            rotated_text += rotation_dict[char]
        else:
            rotated_text += char
    
    return rotated_text
```

This code first converts the input text to lowercase to simplify things. It then creates a dictionary where each key is a letter of the alphabet and its value is the letter that should replace it after being rotated by the specified number of positions (the key). We calculate this by subtracting the ASCII code of `'a'` from the ASCII code of the current letter (`ord(char)`), adding the key, taking the remainder when divided by 26 (to wrap around at the end of the alphabet), and adding back the ASCII code of `'a'` again.


Next, we iterate through each character in the original text and check whether it is a letter. If it is, we look up its rotated version in the dictionary and add it to the `rotated_text` string. Otherwise, we just append the non-letter characters directly.


Finally, we return the resulting rotated text. Note that this implementation preserves capitalization by only rotating lowercase letters; uppercase letters are left unchanged. You can modify it to rotate both cases if desired.
