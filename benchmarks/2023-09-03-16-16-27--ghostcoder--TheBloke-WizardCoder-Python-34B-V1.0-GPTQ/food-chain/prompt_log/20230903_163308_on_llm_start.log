### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.

While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.

This is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.

This is one of many common variants.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: food_chain.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: food_chain.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here is the modified `food_chain.py` file with the required changes:
```python
def recite(start_verse=1, end_verse=-1):
    """Recites the song starting at start_verse and ending at end_verse.

    Args:
        start_verse (int): The first verse to include in the output (inclusive). Defaults to 1 if not specified.
        end_verse (int): The last verse to include in the output (inclusive). If -1 or greater than total verses, all verses are included.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing the requested verses of the song.
    """
    
    # Define the verses as lists of strings for easier manipulation
    animals = ['fly', 'spider', 'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'goat', 'cow']
    actions = ['It{} {}'.format(' eats' * i + (' swallowed the {} to catch the {}.
'.format(animals[i], animals[i+1]) if i < len(animals)-1 else ' swallowed the {} to catch the fly.
I don\'t know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she\'ll die.' + '
') for i in range(len(animals))]
    
    # Set default values for end_verse if necessary
    if end_verse == -1 or end_verse > len(animals):
        end_verse = len(animals)
    
    # Create the final list of lines for each verse
    lines = []
    for i in range(end_verse):
        line = "I know an old lady who swallowed a {}.".format(animals[i])
        for action in reversed(actions[:i+1]):
            line += action.replace('{}', '' if i == 0 else ' the').replace('the ' + animals[-1], '')
        lines.append(line)
    
    return "
".join(lines[start_verse-1:end_verse])
```

This implementation uses two lists to store the animal names and actions, then iterates through them up to the desired number of verses, building the appropriate sentence structure using string formatting. It also handles the case where no value is provided for `end_verse`, by setting it to the length of the `animals` list. Finally, it returns the requested verses joined into one string separated by newlines.
