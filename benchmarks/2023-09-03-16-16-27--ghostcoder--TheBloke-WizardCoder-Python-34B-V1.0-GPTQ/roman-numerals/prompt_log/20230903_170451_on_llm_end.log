Here's one possible implementation of the `roman` function that converts an integer to its equivalent Roman numeral representation:


```python
def roman(num):
    if num < 1 or num > 39999:
        raise ValueError("Number must be between 1 and 39999")
    
    # Define symbols for each digit place and their values
    val = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
    syb = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]
    
    # Build the Roman numeral string by iterating through the digits and subtracting their values until we reach 0
    res = ""
    for v, s in zip(val, syb):
        while num >= v:
            res += s
            num -= v
    
    return res
```

We start by checking that the input number is within the valid range (between 1 and 39999), then define two lists: `val` contains the decimal values of each symbol, and `syb` contains the corresponding symbols.

Next, we iterate over both lists simultaneously using `zip`, comparing each pair of values and adding the appropriate symbol to our output string (`res`) until the remaining number becomes less than the current value. We keep track of the subtraction by decrementing `num`. Finally, we return the resulting string.


Note that we could also use a dictionary instead of two separate lists, like so:


```python
symbols = {
    1000: 'M',
    900: 'CM',
    500: 'D',
    400: 'CD',
    100: 'C',
    90: 'XC',
    50: 'L',
    40: 'XL',
    10: 'X',
    9: 'IX',
    5: 'V',
    4: 'IV',
    1: 'I'
}

for v, s in symbols.items():
    while num >= v:
        res += s
        num -= v
```

But since the list approach works just fine, there's no need to complicate things further.
