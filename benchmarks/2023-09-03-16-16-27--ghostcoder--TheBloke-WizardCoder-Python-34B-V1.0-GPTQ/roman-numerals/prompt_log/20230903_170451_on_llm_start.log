### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans were a clever bunch.
They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.
They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis.
One thing they never discovered though was the number zero.
This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.
For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
(notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

```text
 1  => I
10  => X
 7  => VII
```

The maximum number supported by this notation is 3,999.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: roman_numerals.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's one possible implementation of the `roman` function that converts an integer to its equivalent Roman numeral representation:
```python
def roman(num):
    if num < 1 or num > 39999:
        raise ValueError("Number must be between 1 and 39999")
    
    # Define symbols for each digit place and their values
    val = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
    syb = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]
    
    # Build the Roman numeral string by iterating through the digits and subtracting their values until we reach 0
    res = ""
    for v, s in zip(val, syb):
        while num >= v:
            res += s
            num -= v
    
    return res
```

We start by checking that the input number is within the valid range (between 1 and 39999), then define two lists: `val` contains the decimal values of each symbol, and `syb` contains the corresponding symbols.

Next, we iterate over both lists simultaneously using `zip`, comparing each pair of values and adding the appropriate symbol to our output string (`res`) until the remaining number becomes less than the current value. We keep track of the subtraction by decrementing `num`. Finally, we return the resulting string.


Note that we could also use a dictionary instead of two separate lists, like so:
```python
symbols = {
    1000: 'M',
    900: 'CM',
    500: 'D',
    400: 'CD',
    100: 'C',
    90: 'XC',
    50: 'L',
    40: 'XL',
    10: 'X',
    9: 'IX',
    5: 'V',
    4: 'IV',
    1: 'I'
}

for v, s in symbols.items():
    while num >= v:
        res += s
        num -= v
```

But since the list approach works just fine, there's no need to complicate things further.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in roman_numerals.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: roman_numerals.py
```python
def roman(number):
    pass
