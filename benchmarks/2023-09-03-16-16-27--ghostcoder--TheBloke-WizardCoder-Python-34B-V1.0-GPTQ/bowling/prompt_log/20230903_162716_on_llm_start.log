### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Score a bowling game.

Bowling is a game where players roll a heavy ball to knock down pins arranged in a triangle.
Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.

## Scoring Bowling

The game consists of 10 frames.
A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization.
There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.

- An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame.
  In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.

- A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second throw.
  The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.

- A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first throw.
  The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two throws.
  If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.

Here is a three frame example:

| Frame 1         | Frame 2       | Frame 3                |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :---------------------:|
| X (strike)      | 5/ (spare)    | 9 0 (open frame)       |

Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20

Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19

Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9

This means the current running total is 48.

The tenth frame in the game is a special case.
If someone throws a spare or a strike then they get one or two fill balls respectively.
Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame.
Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls.
The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.

For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.

For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.

## Requirements

Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.
It should support two operations:

- `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.
  The argument is the number of pins knocked down.
- `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.
  It returns the total score for that game.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" an error when the scoring or playing rules are not followed. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when a bonus is attempted with an open frame
raise IndexError("cannot throw bonus with an open tenth frame")

# example when fill balls are invalid
raise ValueError("invalid fill balls")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bowling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
