Here's a possible implementation for `largest_product` that should fix the issues with the provided tests:

```python
def largest_product(digits, n):
    if not digits or len(digits) < n:
        return None
    
    max_product = -float('inf')
    for i in range(len(digits)-n+1):
        product = int(digits[i]) * int(digits[i+1 : i+n].lstrip('0'))
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product
    
    return max_product
```

Explanation:

- The function first checks whether there are enough digits in the input string to form a series of length `n`. If not, it returns `None`.
- It initializes `max_product` as negative infinity so that any valid product will be greater than it.
- Then it iterates over all possible starting positions of the series and calculates its value by multiplying the current digit (`int(digits[i]`) with the remaining digits stripped from leading zeros (`int(digits[i+1 : i+n].lstrip('0')`). This is done because we don't want to include trailing zeroes when calculating the product.
- For each iteration, it updates `max_product` if the calculated product is greater than the previous maximum.
- Finally, it returns the maximum product found.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input only contains digits. If non-digit characters may appear in the input, you can add some validation before calling `int()` on them.
