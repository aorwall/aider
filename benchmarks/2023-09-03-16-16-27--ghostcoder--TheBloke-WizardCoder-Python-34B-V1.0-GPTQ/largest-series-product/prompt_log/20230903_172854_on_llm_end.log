Here's the modified solution for the given problem:

```python
def largest_product(series, span):
    """
    Calculate the largest product of a contiguous substring of digits of length 'span' within the given series.
    
    Args:
        series (str): A string containing only digits.
        span (int): Length of substrings whose products are being considered.
    Returns:
        int: The maximum product of the substrings of length 'span'.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If either 'span' is greater than the length of 'series', less than zero, or contains non-numeric characters.
    """
    # Check if span is valid
    if len(series) < span or span <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Span must be positive and less than or equal to the length of the series.")
    elif not all(char.isdigit() for char in series):
        raise ValueError("Series must consist of numeric characters only.")
    else:
        max_product = float('-inf')
        for i in range(len(series)-span+1):
            substr = series[i:i+span]
            product = 1
            for num in map(int,substr):
                product *= num
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
        return max_product
```

We first check whether the given span is valid by checking if it is greater than the length of the series or less than or equal to zero. We also check if each character in the series is a digit using the `isdigit()` method. If there is any non-numeric character present, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. Otherwise, we initialize `max_product` to negative infinity and iterate over the series, slicing out substrings of length `span`, converting them into integers and multiplying them together to get their product. If the current product is greater than the previous maximum product, we update `max_product`. Finally, we return `max_product`.
