        "text": "# Introduction\n\nYou work for a government agency that has intercepted a series of encrypted communication signals from a group of bank robbers.\nThe signals contain a long sequence of digits.\nYour team needs to use various digital signal processing techniques to analyze the signals and identify any patterns that may indicate the planning of a heist.\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to look for patterns in the long sequence of digits in the encrypted signal.\n\nThe technique you're going to use here is called the largest series product.\n\nLet's define a few terms, first.\n\n- **input**: the sequence of digits that you need to analyze\n- **series**: a sequence of adjacent digits (those that are next to each other) that is contained within the input\n- **span**: how many digits long each series is\n- **product**: what you get when you multiply numbers together\n\nLet's work through an example, with the input `\"63915\"`.\n\n- To form a series, take adjacent digits in the original input.\n- If you are working with a span of `3`, there will be three possible series:\n  - `\"639\"`\n  - `\"391\"`\n  - `\"915\"`\n- Then we need to calculate the product of each series:\n  - The product of the series `\"639\"` is 162 (`6 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9 = 162`)\n  - The product of the series `\"391\"` is 27 (`3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 = 27`)\n  - The product of the series `\"915\"` is 45 (`9 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 = 45`)\n- 162 is bigger than both 27 and 45, so the largest series product of `\"63915\"` is from the series `\"639\"`.\n  So the answer is **162**.\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when your `largest_product()` function receives invalid input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  Feel free to reuse your code from the `series` exercise!\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# span of numbers is longer than number series\nraise ValueError(\"span must be smaller than string length\")\n\n# span of number is negative\nraise ValueError(\"span must not be negative\")\n\n# series includes non-number input\nraise ValueError(\"digits input must only contain digits\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: largest_series_product.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

If not, it returns `None`.\n- It initializes `max_product` as negative infinity so that any valid product will be greater than it.\n- Then it iterates over all possible starting positions of the series and calculates its value by multiplying the current digit (`int(digits[i]`) with the remaining digits stripped from leading zeros (`int(digits[i+1 : i+n].lstrip('0')`). This is done because we don't want to include trailing zeroes when calculating the product.\n- For each iteration, it updates `max_product` if the calculated product is greater than the previous maximum.\n- Finally, it returns the maximum product found.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input only contains digits. If non-digit characters may appear in the input, you can add some validation before calling `int()` on them.",
