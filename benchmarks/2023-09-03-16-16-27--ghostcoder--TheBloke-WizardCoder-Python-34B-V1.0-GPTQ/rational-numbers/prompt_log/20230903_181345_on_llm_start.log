### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.

~~~~exercism/note
Note that mathematically, the denominator can't be zero.
However in many implementations of rational numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.
In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.
~~~~

The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.

The sum of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ + r₂ = a₁/b₁ + a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

The difference of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ - r₂ = a₁/b₁ - a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ * r₂ = (a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

Dividing a rational number `r₁ = a₁/b₁` by another `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ / r₂ = (a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)` if `a₂` is not zero.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.

Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.

Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.

Implement the following operations:

- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,
- absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.

Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.
For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.
To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.
So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.
The reduced form of a rational number should be in "standard form" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).
If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.
For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`

Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.

Explanation:

We first define a helper function `lcm()` which returns the least common multiple of two integers.
In `__init__()`, we check if the denominator is negative and swap the signs of numerator and denominator accordingly. We then calculate the GCD value and reduce the fraction to its simplest form.

In `__add__()`, we perform regular addition of fractions by multiplying each fraction by the LCM of their denominators and adding the numerators. The resulting numerator and denominator are returned as a new instance of the Rational class.

In `__sub__()`, we perform subtraction similarly by multiplying each fraction by the LCM of their denominators and subtracting the numerators. The resulting numerator and denominator are returned as a new instance of the Rational class.

In `__mul__()`, we simply multiply the numerators and denominators of the two fractions and return them as a new instance of the Rational class after reducing it to its simplest form.

In `__truediv__()`, we perform division by multiplying the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second and vice versa, and returning the result as a new instance of the Rational class after reducing it to its simplest form.

In `__abs__()`, we create a new instance of the Rational class with absolute values of numerator and denominator.

In `__pow__()`, we handle three cases: when the power is zero, greater than zero, and less than zero. If the power is zero, we return 1/1. If the power is greater than zero, we raise the numerator and denominator to the given power and return the result as a new instance of the Rational class. If the power is less than zero, we switch the numerator and denominator and raise the denominator to the absolute value of the power and return the reciprocal.

In `__rpow__()`, we check if the denominator is one because raising a fraction to a non-integer power is undefined. Then, we compute the power of the base raised to the reciprocal of the denominator and return the result as a new instance of the Rational class. Note that this method only works for integer bases. For non-integer bases, we would need to approximate the result using floating point arithmetic.
