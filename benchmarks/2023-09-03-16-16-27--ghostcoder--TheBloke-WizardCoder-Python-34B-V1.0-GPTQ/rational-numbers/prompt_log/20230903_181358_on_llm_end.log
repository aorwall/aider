The `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__` and `__ge__` methods are missing from the `Rational` class implementation. Here is a possible implementation of these methods using the existing methods:

```python
class Rational:
    ...
    
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return float(self) < float(other)
    
    def __le__(self, other):
        return float(self) <= float(other)
    
    def __gt__(self, other):
        return float(self) > float(other)
    
    def __ge__(self, other):
        return float(self) >= float(other)
```

These methods compare two rational numbers by converting them to floats before comparing their values.

Note that this may not always give accurate results due to floating-point rounding errors, but it should work well enough for most practical purposes. If you need exact comparisons between rationals without loss of precision, you can implement separate comparison methods or use a library like [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html).
