        "text": "Explanation:\n\nWe first define a helper function `lcm()` which returns the least common multiple of two integers.\nIn `__init__()`, we check if the denominator is negative and swap the signs of numerator and denominator accordingly. We then calculate the GCD value and reduce the fraction to its simplest form.\n\nIn `__add__()`, we perform regular addition of fractions by multiplying each fraction by the LCM of their denominators and adding the numerators. The resulting numerator and denominator are returned as a new instance of the Rational class.\n\nIn `__sub__()`, we perform subtraction similarly by multiplying each fraction by the LCM of their denominators and subtracting the numerators. The resulting numerator and denominator are returned as a new instance of the Rational class.\n\nIn `__mul__()`, we simply multiply the numerators and denominators of the two fractions and return them as a new instance of the Rational class after reducing it to its simplest form.\n\nIn `__truediv__()`, we perform division by multiplying the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second and vice versa, and returning the result as a new instance of the Rational class after reducing it to its simplest form.\n\nIn `__abs__()`, we create a new instance of the Rational class with absolute values of numerator and denominator.\n\nIn `__pow__()`, we handle three cases: when the power is zero, greater than zero, and less than zero. If the power is zero, we return 1/1. If the power is greater than zero, we raise the numerator and denominator to the given power and return the result as a new instance of the Rational class. If the power is less than zero, we switch the numerator and denominator and raise the denominator to the absolute value of the power and return the reciprocal.\n\nIn `__rpow__()`, we check if the denominator is one because raising a fraction to a non-integer power is undefined. Then, we compute the power of the base raised to the reciprocal of the denominator and return the result as a new instance of the Rational class. Note that this method only works for integer bases. For non-integer bases, we would need to approximate the result using floating point arithmetic.",
