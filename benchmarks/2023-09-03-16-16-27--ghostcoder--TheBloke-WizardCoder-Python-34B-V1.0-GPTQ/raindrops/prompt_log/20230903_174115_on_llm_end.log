Here is the corrected implementation of `raindrops.py`:

```python
def convert(number):
    sounds = {
        3: 'Pling',
        5: 'Plang',
        7: 'Plong'
    }
    divisible_by = {num: sounds[num] for num in [3, 5, 7] if number % num == 0}
    
    if not divisible_by:
        return str(number)
    else:
        return ''.join([sounds[divisible] for divisible in sorted(divisible_by)]).replace('Plink', '').replace('Plank', '')
```

Explanation:

We create a dictionary that maps each factor with its corresponding sound and then check which factors the given number is divisible by using list comprehension. We store those factors as keys in another dictionary called `divisible_by`. If there are no such factors, we simply return the string representation of the number.

If there are any factors, we join all their sounds together into one string and remove any duplicate occurrences of 'Plink' or 'Plank' since they have been replaced by 'Pling' and 'Plong' respectively. The resulting string is returned.
