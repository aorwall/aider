Great job! The updated implementation of `BankAccount` now passes all the tests and meets the requirements specified by the prompt. Here's a summary of what you did:


1. You added an instance variable `_is_open` that keeps track of whether or not the account is currently open.
2. In `__init__`, set `_is_open` to `False`.
3. Added checks for opening an account that was already opened (`open()`), closing an unopened account (`withdraw()`, `deposit()`, and `get_balance()`).
4. Fixed the error message for invalid amounts in `deposit()`.
5. Implemented `close()` method to mark the account closed.
6. Updated `withdraw()` to check if the account is open before processing the transaction.
7. Updated `get_balance()` to check if the account is open before returning the balance.
8. Added a test case for trying to close an account that wasn't opened.

These changes ensure that the class behaves correctly according to its specifications. Good work!
