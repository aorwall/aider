### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.
Watch out for concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways.
Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc.
Shops can charge against the account.

Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language).

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  


```python
# account is not open
raise ValueError('account not open')

# account is already open
raise ValueError('account already open')

# incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount
raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')

# withdrawal is too big
raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's the modified implementation of the BankAccount class with all required functionalities:
Filepath: bank_account.py
```
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._is_open = False
        self._balance = 0

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance

    def open(self):
        if self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account already open")
        else:
            self._is_open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account not open")
        elif amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("amount must be greater than 0")
        else:
            self._balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account not open")
        elif amount > self._balance:
            raise ValueError("amount must be less than balance")
        elif amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("amount must be greater than 0")
        else:
            self._balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        self._is_open = False

```

Explanation:

1. We initialize `_is_open` attribute to keep track whether the account is open or not.
2. In `__init__()` method we set its value to `False`.
3. In `get_balance()` method we simply return the current balance of the account.
4. In `open()` method we check if the account is already open using the `_is_open` attribute. If yes, then we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message otherwise we mark the account as opened by setting `_is_open` to `True`.
5. In `deposit()` method we first check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is positive, if not we raise another `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we add the amount to the balance.
6. In `withdraw()` method we again check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is within limits i.e., less than balance and greater than zero, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we subtract the amount from the balance.
7. In `close()` method we just set the `_is_open` attribute to `False`, indicating that the account has been closed.

Note: It is important to note that we have used underscore (`_`) before instance variables to make them private so that they cannot be accessed directly outside the class. However, we can access these attributes inside the class methods using `self._attribute_name`. 

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in bank_account.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: bank_account.py
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._is_open = False
        self._balance = 0

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance

    def open(self):
        if self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account already open")
        else:
            self._is_open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account not open")
        elif amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("amount must be greater than 0")
        else:
            self._balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):

        else:
            self._balance -= amount

    def close(self):
