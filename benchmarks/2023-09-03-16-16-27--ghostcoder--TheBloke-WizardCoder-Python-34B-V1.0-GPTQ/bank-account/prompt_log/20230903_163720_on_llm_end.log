Here's the modified implementation of the BankAccount class with all required functionalities:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._is_open = False
        self._balance = 0

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance

    def open(self):
        if self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account already open")
        else:
            self._is_open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account not open")
        elif amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("amount must be greater than 0")
        else:
            self._balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError("account not open")
        elif amount > self._balance:
            raise ValueError("amount must be less than balance")
        elif amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("amount must be greater than 0")
        else:
            self._balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        self._is_open = False
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize `_is_open` attribute to keep track whether the account is open or not.
2. In `__init__()` method we set its value to `False`.
3. In `get_balance()` method we simply return the current balance of the account.
4. In `open()` method we check if the account is already open using the `_is_open` attribute. If yes, then we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message otherwise we mark the account as opened by setting `_is_open` to `True`.
5. In `deposit()` method we first check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is positive, if not we raise another `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we add the amount to the balance.
6. In `withdraw()` method we again check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is within limits i.e., less than balance and greater than zero, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we subtract the amount from the balance.
7. In `close()` method we just set the `_is_open` attribute to `False`, indicating that the account has been closed.

Note: It is important to note that we have used underscore (`_`) before instance variables to make them private so that they cannot be accessed directly outside the class. However, we can access these attributes inside the class methods using `self._attribute_name`. 

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
