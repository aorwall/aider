When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  \n\n\n```python\n# account is not open\nraise ValueError('account not open')\n\n# account is already open\nraise ValueError('account already open')\n\n# incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount\nraise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')\n\n# withdrawal is too big\nraise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')\n```\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

In `get_balance()` method we simply return the current balance of the account.\n4. In `open()` method we check if the account is already open using the `_is_open` attribute. If yes, then we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message otherwise we mark the account as opened by setting `_is_open` to `True`.\n5. In `deposit()` method we first check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is positive, if not we raise another `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we add the amount to the balance.\n6. In `withdraw()` method we again check if the account is open, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Then we check if the amount is within limits i.e., less than balance and greater than zero, if not we raise a `ValueError` with appropriate message. Otherwise, we subtract the amount from the balance.\n7. In `close()` method we just set the `_is_open` attribute to `False`, indicating that the account has been closed.\n\nNote: It is important to note that we have used underscore (`_`) before instance variables to make them private so that they cannot be accessed directly outside the class. However, we can access these attributes inside the class methods using `self._attribute_name`. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",

You added an instance variable `_is_open` that keeps track of whether or not the account is currently open.\n2. In `__init__`, set `_is_open` to `False`.\n3. Added checks for opening an account that was already opened (`open()`), closing an unopened account (`withdraw()`, `deposit()`, and `get_balance()`).\n4. Fixed the error message for invalid amounts in `deposit()`.\n5. Implemented `close()` method to mark the account closed.\n6. Updated `withdraw()` to check if the account is open before processing the transaction.\n7. Updated `get_balance()` to check if the account is open before returning the balance.\n8. Added a test case for trying to close an account that wasn't opened.\n\nThese changes ensure that the class behaves correctly according to its specifications. Good work!",
