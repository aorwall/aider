Here's how I would solve the problem:

```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    # Create an empty list to store the results.
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the collection and apply the operation to it, appending the result to the output list.
    for item in collection:
        result.append(operation(item))
    
    # Return the resulting list.
    return result
```

We can call this function like so:

```python
squares = accumulate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lambda x: x ** 2)
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This implementation uses a simple loop to iterate through each item in the collection and applies the specified operation (in this case, squaring each number), and adds the result to a new list. Finally, it returns the resulting list. We could also write this more concisely using a list comprehension:


```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    return [operation(item) for item in collection]
```

Either way works fine, but the first version may be easier to understand for beginners who aren't familiar with list comprehensions.
