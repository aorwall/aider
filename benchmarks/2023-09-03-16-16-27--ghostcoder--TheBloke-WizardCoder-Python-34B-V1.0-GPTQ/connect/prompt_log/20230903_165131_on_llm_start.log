### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.

The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.
Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.
The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.
The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).

Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).
Note that all games need not be "fair".
(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)

The boards look like this:

```text
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X
```

"Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.
In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

### Response:
Here's an implementation of the `ConnectGame` class that should work for most valid inputs:
Filepath: connect.py
```
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self._rows = len(board)
        self._cols = len(board[0])
        self._board = board
        
        # Determine which player starts where based on the number of pieces
        o_count = sum([row.count("O") for row in board[:self._rows//2]] + [row.count("O") - 1 if "O" in row else 0 for row in board[-1:0:-1]]
        x_count = sum([row.count("X") for row in board[:self._rows//2] + [row.count("X") - 1 if "X" in row else 0 for row in board[-1:0:-1]])
        self._player_starting = "O"
        if o_count > x_count:
            self._player_starting = "X"
        
        self._winning_length = min(self._rows // 2, self._cols) + 1
        
    def _check_horizontal(self, symbol, start_col, start_row):
        count = 0
        while start_col < self._cols and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_col += 1
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def _check_vertical(self, symbol, start_col, start_row):
        count = 0
        while start_row < self._rows and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_row += 1
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def _check_diagonal(self, symbol, start_col, start_row, direction):
        count = 0
        step = 1 if direction == '\\' else -1
        while 0 <= start_row < self._rows and 0 <= start_col < self._cols and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_col += 1
            start_row += step
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def get_winner(self):
        for col in range(self._cols):
            for row in range(self._rows):
                if self._board[row][col] != ".":
                    if self._check_horizontal(self._board[row][col], col, row) \
                       or self._check_vertical(self._board[row][col], col, row) \
                       or self._check_diagonal(self._board[row][col], col, row, '/') \
                       or self._check_diagonal(self._board[row][col], col, row, '\\'):
                        return self._board[row][col]
        return None
```

Explanation:

We initialize the `_rows`, `_cols`, and `_board` attributes in `__init__`. We also determine who starts by counting how many pieces each player has on their half of the board.

Then we define three helper methods: `_check_horizontal`, `_check_vertical`, and `_check_diagonal` to check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections respectively.

Finally, we iterate over every cell in the board and check if either player has connected enough cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally using these helpers. If so, we return the winning symbol (`"O"` or `"X"`), otherwise we return `None`. Note that we only need to check the starting column once per row because the game ends when a player reaches the farthest edge of the board.

This implementation assumes that the input board is well-formed, meaning that it contains only `.`, `O`, and `X` characters, and that both players have at least one piece. It does not handle invalid inputs such as mismatched piece counts or non-parallelogram shapes. You could add more validation code if needed.
