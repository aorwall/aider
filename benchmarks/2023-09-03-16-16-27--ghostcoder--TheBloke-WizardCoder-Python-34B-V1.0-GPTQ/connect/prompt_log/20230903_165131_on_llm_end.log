Here's an implementation of the `ConnectGame` class that should work for most valid inputs:

```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self._rows = len(board)
        self._cols = len(board[0])
        self._board = board
        
        # Determine which player starts where based on the number of pieces
        o_count = sum([row.count("O") for row in board[:self._rows//2]] + [row.count("O") - 1 if "O" in row else 0 for row in board[-1:0:-1]]
        x_count = sum([row.count("X") for row in board[:self._rows//2] + [row.count("X") - 1 if "X" in row else 0 for row in board[-1:0:-1]])
        self._player_starting = "O"
        if o_count > x_count:
            self._player_starting = "X"
        
        self._winning_length = min(self._rows // 2, self._cols) + 1
        
    def _check_horizontal(self, symbol, start_col, start_row):
        count = 0
        while start_col < self._cols and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_col += 1
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def _check_vertical(self, symbol, start_col, start_row):
        count = 0
        while start_row < self._rows and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_row += 1
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def _check_diagonal(self, symbol, start_col, start_row, direction):
        count = 0
        step = 1 if direction == '\\' else -1
        while 0 <= start_row < self._rows and 0 <= start_col < self._cols and self._board[start_row][start_col] == symbol:
            count += 1
            start_col += 1
            start_row += step
        return count >= self._winning_length
    
    def get_winner(self):
        for col in range(self._cols):
            for row in range(self._rows):
                if self._board[row][col] != ".":
                    if self._check_horizontal(self._board[row][col], col, row) \
                       or self._check_vertical(self._board[row][col], col, row) \
                       or self._check_diagonal(self._board[row][col], col, row, '/') \
                       or self._check_diagonal(self._board[row][col], col, row, '\\'):
                        return self._board[row][col]
        return None
```

Explanation:

We initialize the `_rows`, `_cols`, and `_board` attributes in `__init__`. We also determine who starts by counting how many pieces each player has on their half of the board.

Then we define three helper methods: `_check_horizontal`, `_check_vertical`, and `_check_diagonal` to check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections respectively.

Finally, we iterate over every cell in the board and check if either player has connected enough cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally using these helpers. If so, we return the winning symbol (`"O"` or `"X"`), otherwise we return `None`. Note that we only need to check the starting column once per row because the game ends when a player reaches the farthest edge of the board.

This implementation assumes that the input board is well-formed, meaning that it contains only `.`, `O`, and `X` characters, and that both players have at least one piece. It does not handle invalid inputs such as mismatched piece counts or non-parallelogram shapes. You could add more validation code if needed.
