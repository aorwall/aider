If the `name` is already present in `_roster`, it returns a message indicating that the student has been added before. Otherwise, it adds the `name` to the corresponding grade list using the `setdefault()` method. This creates the grade list if it doesn't exist yet and appends the `name` to it.\n- The `roster()` method iterates over the keys of `_roster` (i.e. the grades) in ascending order (`sorted()`), gets the list of students for each grade, sorts them alphabetically (`sorted()` again), joins them into a string separated by commas and newlines (`\", \".join()`), and concatenates them with the grade number. It then returns the resulting string without the last newline character (`[:-1]`).\n- The `grade()` method takes a single argument `grade_number` and tries to get the list of students for that grade from `_roster`. If there are no students in that grade, it raises a `KeyError`, so we catch it and return a message saying there are no students found. Otherwise, it returns a string listing the students in that grade followed by their count.\n- The `@property` decorator defines a read-only property `added` that returns a multi-line string with the current state of `_roster`. Each line lists the grade and its students separated by colons, and each group of students is comma-separated.\n\nExample usage:",
