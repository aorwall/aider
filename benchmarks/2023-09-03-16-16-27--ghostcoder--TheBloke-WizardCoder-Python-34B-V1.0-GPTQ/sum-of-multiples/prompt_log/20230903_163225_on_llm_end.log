Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_multiples` function using Python's built-in functions:

```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_multiples(level, factors):
    """Calculates the sum of unique multiples of factors up to the level."""
    def get_multiples(factor):
        return set(range(factor, level, factor))
    
    # Get the multiples of each factor up to the level.
    multiples_sets = [get_multiples(f) for f in factors]
    
    # Combine them into one set without duplicates.
    combined_set = set().union(*multiples_sets)
    
    # Return the sum of the resulting set.
    return sum(combined_set)
```

Explanation:

We define a helper function `get_multiples` that takes a single factor and returns a set of its multiples up to the level. We then create a list comprehension that applies this function to each factor in `factors`, creating a list of sets containing their respective multiples. Finally, we combine all sets into one using the `set.union()` method, which removes duplicates automatically. Then we simply compute the sum of the resulting set using the built-in `sum()` function.


Note that we could also have used the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module to achieve the same result:

```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_multiples(level, factors):
    """Calculates the sum of unique multiples of factors up to the level."""
    def union_sets(x, y):
        return x | y
    
    # Create a set of multiples for each factor.
    multiples_sets = [set(range(f, level, f)) for f in factors]
    
    # Combine them into one set without duplicates.
    combined_set = reduce(union_sets, multiples_sets)
    
    # Return the sum of the resulting set.
    return sum(combined_set)
```

This version uses the `|` operator to merge sets instead of the `set.union()` method, but it does essentially the same thing. However, I prefer the first approach because it's more concise and easier to read.
