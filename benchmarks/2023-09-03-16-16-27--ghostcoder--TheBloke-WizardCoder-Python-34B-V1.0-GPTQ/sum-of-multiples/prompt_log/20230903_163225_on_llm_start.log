### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Introduction

You work for a company that makes an online, fantasy-survival game.

When a player finishes a level, they are awarded energy points.
The amount of energy awarded depends on which magical items the player found while exploring that level.
# Instructions

Your task is to write the code that calculates the energy points that get awarded to players when they complete a level.

The points awarded depend on two things:

- The level (a number) that the player completed.
- The base value of each magical item collected by the player during that level.

The energy points are awarded according to the following rules:

1. For each magical item, take the base value and find all the multiples of that value that are less than the level number.
2. Combine the sets of numbers.
3. Remove any duplicates.
4. Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.

Let's look at an example:

**The player completed level 20 and found two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.**

To calculate the energy points earned by the player, we need to find all the unique multiples of these base values that are less than level 20.

- Multiples of 3 less than 20: `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}`
- Multiples of 5 less than 20: `{5, 10, 15}`
- Combine the sets and remove duplicates: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18}`
- Sum the unique multiples: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`
- Therefore, the player earns **78** energy points for completing level 20 and finding the two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.
# Instructions append

You can make the following assumptions about the inputs to the
`sum_of_multiples` function:
* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers
including zero.
* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique
and sorted in ascending order.

### Response:
Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_multiples` function using Python's built-in functions:
```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_multiples(level, factors):
    """Calculates the sum of unique multiples of factors up to the level."""
    def get_multiples(factor):
        return set(range(factor, level, factor))
    
    # Get the multiples of each factor up to the level.
    multiples_sets = [get_multiples(f) for f in factors]
    
    # Combine them into one set without duplicates.
    combined_set = set().union(*multiples_sets)
    
    # Return the sum of the resulting set.
    return sum(combined_set)
```

Explanation:

We define a helper function `get_multiples` that takes a single factor and returns a set of its multiples up to the level. We then create a list comprehension that applies this function to each factor in `factors`, creating a list of sets containing their respective multiples. Finally, we combine all sets into one using the `set.union()` method, which removes duplicates automatically. Then we simply compute the sum of the resulting set using the built-in `sum()` function.


Note that we could also have used the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module to achieve the same result:
```python
from functools import reduce

def sum_of_multiples(level, factors):
    """Calculates the sum of unique multiples of factors up to the level."""
    def union_sets(x, y):
        return x | y
    
    # Create a set of multiples for each factor.
    multiples_sets = [set(range(f, level, f)) for f in factors]
    
    # Combine them into one set without duplicates.
    combined_set = reduce(union_sets, multiples_sets)
    
    # Return the sum of the resulting set.
    return sum(combined_set)
```

This version uses the `|` operator to merge sets instead of the `set.union()` method, but it does essentially the same thing. However, I prefer the first approach because it's more concise and easier to read.
