Here's a possible implementation for `sum_of_multiples` that passes all the given tests and should work correctly for any input:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, factors):
    """Return the sum of all numbers less than limit that are divisible by at least one factor from factors."""
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, limit):
        if any(i % f == 0 for f in factors):
            total += i
    return total
```

This function uses a loop to iterate over all numbers between 1 and `limit`, checking whether each number is divisible by any of the factors in `factors`. If it is, then we add it to the running total. At the end, we return the total.

Note that this implementation doesn't use any special tricks or optimizations - it simply checks every number individually using a simple loop. This means that it may be slow for very large limits with many factors, but it works fine for small inputs like those used in the tests. For larger values, there are more efficient algorithms that can be used instead, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or dynamic programming techniques. However, these require more complex code and might not be necessary for the purposes of this exercise.
