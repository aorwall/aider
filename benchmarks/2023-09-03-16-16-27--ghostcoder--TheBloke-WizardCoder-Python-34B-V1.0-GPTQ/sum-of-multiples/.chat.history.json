For each magical item, take the base value and find all the multiples of that value that are less than the level number.\n2. Combine the sets of numbers.\n3. Remove any duplicates.\n4. Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n**The player completed level 20 and found two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.**\n\nTo calculate the energy points earned by the player, we need to find all the unique multiples of these base values that are less than level 20.\n\n- Multiples of 3 less than 20: `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}`\n- Multiples of 5 less than 20: `{5, 10, 15}`\n- Combine the sets and remove duplicates: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18}`\n- Sum the unique multiples: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`\n- Therefore, the player earns **78** energy points for completing level 20 and finding the two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.\n# Instructions append\n\nYou can make the following assumptions about the inputs to the\n`sum_of_multiples` function:\n* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers\nincluding zero.\n* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique\nand sorted in ascending order.\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sum_of_multiples.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nDo not implement or change any unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

Finally, we combine all sets into one using the `set.union()` method, which removes duplicates automatically.
