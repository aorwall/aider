Here's a possible implementation for `parse_octal` that passes all the given tests:

```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    if digits == '':
        raise ValueError('Empty string is not valid')
    elif any(c not in '01234567' for c in digits):
        raise ValueError('Invalid character found')
    else:
        return int(digits, base=8)
```

This function first checks whether the input string is empty or contains invalid characters (i.e., anything other than `'0'`-`'7'`). If either of these conditions is true, it raises an exception.
Otherwise, it converts the input string from octal representation to decimal using Python's built-in `int()` function and returns the result. The second argument (`base`) specifies the radix (or base) of the number system used to interpret the string as an integer. In this case, we use `8`, which means that each digit represents its value in octal notation (i.e., `0`-`7`).
