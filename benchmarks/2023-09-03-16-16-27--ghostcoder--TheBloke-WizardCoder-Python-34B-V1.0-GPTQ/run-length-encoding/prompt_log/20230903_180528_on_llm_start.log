### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Implement run-length encoding and decoding.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data elements) are replaced by just one data value and count.

For example we can represent the original 53 characters with only 13.

```text
"WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"  ->  "12WB12W3B24WB"
```

RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, which makes it a lossless data compression.

```text
"AABCCCDEEEE"  ->  "2AB3CD4E"  ->  "AABCCCDEEEE"
```

For simplicity, you can assume that the unencoded string will only contain the letters A through Z (either lower or upper case) and whitespace.
This way data to be encoded will never contain any numbers and numbers inside data to be decoded always represent the count for the following character.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: run_length_encoding.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: run_length_encoding.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's an implementation of RLE encoding and decoding functions using Python:
Filepath: run_length_encoding.py
```
def decode(string):
    pass


def encode(string):
    """Encode a string using run-length encoding."""
    if len(string) == 0:
        return ""

    # Initialize variables
    prev_char = None
    count = 1
    result = []

    # Iterate over the input string
    for char in string:
        # If current character is same as previous character, increment counter
        if char == prev_char:
            count += 1
        else:
            # Append the previous character and its count to the result list
            if prev_char != None:
                result.append("{}{}".format(count, prev_char))
            # Set new previous character and reset count to 1
            prev_char = char
            count = 1

    # Append last character and its count to the result list
    result.append("{}{}".format(count, prev_char))

    return ''.join(result)



def decode(string):
    """Decode a string previously encoded with run-length encoding."""
    if len(string) == 0:
        return ""

    # Initialize variables
    index = 0
    result = []

    while index < len(string):
        # Extract count and character from the next two positions in the string
        count = int(string[index])
        char = string[index+1]

        # Repeat the character count number of times and append to result
        for _ in range(count):
            result.append(char)

        # Move to the next pair of characters in the string
        index += 2

    return ''.join(result)

```

The `encode` function iterates over the input string and keeps track of the current character and its count. Whenever there's a change in the character, it appends the previous character and its count to the result list and resets them.

The `decode` function extracts the count and character from every pair of characters in the input string and repeats the character count number of times before moving on to the next pair. It returns the resulting string after joining all the repeated characters together.
