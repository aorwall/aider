Here's the corrected implementation of `allergies.py`:

```python
class Allergies:

    ALLERGENS = {
        0: None,
        1: 'eggs',
        2: 'peanuts',
        4: 'shellfish',
        8: 'strawberries',
        16: 'tomatoes',
        32: 'chocolate',
        64: 'pollen',
        128: 'cats'
    }

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        """Checks if the person is allergic to a specific item."""
        allergen_value = self.ALLERGENS.get(item)
        if not allergen_value:
            raise ValueError('Invalid allergy')
        return bool(self.score & item)

    @property
    def lst(self):
        """Returns a list of all the allergies the person has."""
        return [allergen for key, allergen in self.ALLERGENS.items() if key & self.score != 0 and allergen]
```

Explanation:
- We added a new key-value pair with value `None` at index `0`, so that we can handle invalid input cases.
- In `allergic_to()` method, we used `.get()` instead of indexing directly into the dictionary to avoid raising an error when the given item is not found in the keys of `ALLERGENS`. If the item is not present in the dictionary, it will return `None` which we check before proceeding further.
- In `lst` property, we changed the condition from `key & self.score == key` to `key & self.score != 0` because we want to include all allergens that match any bitwise combination of the input integer. For example, if the input integer is `5`, then both eggs and shellfish should be included since they correspond to binary values `101` and `100` respectively, which have common bits set with `101`. 

Now let's run the tests again:

```bash
$ python -m unittest allergies_test.AllergiesTest
