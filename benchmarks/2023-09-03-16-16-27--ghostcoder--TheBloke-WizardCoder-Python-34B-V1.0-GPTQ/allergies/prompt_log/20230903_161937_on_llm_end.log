Here's an implementation of `Allergies` class with the required methods:

```python
class Allergies:

    ALLERGENS = {
        1: 'eggs',
        2: 'peanuts',
        4: 'shellfish',
        8: 'strawberries',
        16: 'tomatoes',
        32: 'chocolate',
        64: 'pollen',
        128: 'cats'
    }

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        """Checks if the person is allergic to a specific item."""
        allergen_value = self.ALLERGENS[item]
        return bool(allergen_value & self.score)

    @property
    def lst(self):
        """Returns a list of all the allergies the person has."""
        return [allergen for key, allergen in self.ALLERGENS.items() if key & self.score == key]
```

Explanation:

We define a dictionary `ALLERGENS` that maps the allergen values to their names.
In `__init__`, we store the input score as an instance variable `self.score`.
In `allergic_to`, we retrieve the corresponding allergen value using the input item and check if it's set in the binary representation of `self.score`. If it is, then the person is allergic to that item.
In `lst`, we iterate over the keys and values of `ALLERGENS` and append the name of the allergen to a list if its value is set in the binary representation of `self.score`. We can do this because each allergen has a unique power of two value, so checking if it's present in the binary form of `self.score` ensures that we only add allergens that the person is actually allergic to.

Example usage:

```python
>>> a = Allergies(34)
>>> a.allergic_to('peanuts')
True
>>> a.allergic_to('shellfish')
False
>>> a.lst
['peanuts', 'chocolate']
```

This implementation ignores allergens not listed in `ALLERGENS`, since the problem statement asks us to do so. For example,

```python
>>> b = Allergies(257)
>>> b.lst
[]
```

since there is no allergen with value 256.
