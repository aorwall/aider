If a specific key is provided, we use that instead.\n\nIn the `encode()` method, we iterate over each character in the input text and find its index in the alphabet. We add the key value to the index and take the modulus by the length of the alphabet to ensure that we stay within bounds. Then we append the corresponding letter at the new index to the encoded text.\n\nSimilarly, in the `decode()` method, we subtract the key value from the current index to get back the original index and then append the corresponding letter to the decoded text.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input text consists solely of lower case letters. Upper case letters and non-letter characters are ignored. Also, since the key is randomly generated, every time we create a new instance of the `Cipher`, we get a different key. This ensures that the encryption is unbreakable without knowing the key. However, if someone intercepts the message and knows the key, they can easily decode it. To make it more secure, we could use a secret key that is kept hidden from the user.",
