Solution:

To print "Hello, World!" instead of "Goodbye, Mars!" we need to replace the current implementation of `hello()` function.

We can simply return the desired output string directly without using any parameters.


```python
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

This modification passes the test cases mentioned in the problem statement. 

Here's the complete code:

```python
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
