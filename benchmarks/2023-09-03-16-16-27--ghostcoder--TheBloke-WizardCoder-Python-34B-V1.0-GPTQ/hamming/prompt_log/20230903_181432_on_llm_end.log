Here's the modified implementation of the `distance()` function which raises a `ValueError` if the two input strings (DNA sequences) are not of equal length:


```python
def distance(strand_a, strand_b):
    """Calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands."""
    if len(strand_a) != len(strand_b):
        raise ValueError("Strands must be of equal length.")
    
    count = sum([1 for i in range(len(strand_a)) if strand_a[i] != strand_b[i]])
    return count
```

In this solution, we first check whether the lengths of the two input strings (`strand_a` and `strand_b`) are equal. If they are not, then we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

If the lengths are equal, we iterate over each character index in the string and compare the characters at those positions. We increment the `count` variable by 1 every time there is a mismatch between the characters. Finally, we return the total number of such mismatches.
