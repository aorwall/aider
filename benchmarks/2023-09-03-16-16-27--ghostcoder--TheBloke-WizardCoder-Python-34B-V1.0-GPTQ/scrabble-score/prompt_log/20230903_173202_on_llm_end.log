Solution:

We can create a dictionary containing the values of each letter and their corresponding scores.
Then iterate through the letters in the input word and add their scores to get the total score.
If there are any multipliers (double/triple letter), we can check if the current letter is one of them and update the score accordingly.


Here's how it looks like: 

```python
LETTERSCORE = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 3,
    'c': 3,
    'd': 2,
    'e': 1,
    'f': 4,
    'g': 2,
    'h': 4,
    'i': 1,
    'j': 8,
    'k': 5,
    'l': 1,
    'm': 3,
    'n': 1,
    'o': 1,
    'p': 3,
    'q': 10,
    'r': 1,
    's': 1,
    't': 1,
    'u': 1,
    'v': 4,
    'w': 4,
    'x': 8,
    'y': 4,
    'z': 10
}

def score(word):
    # Initialize variables
    total_score = 0
    prev_letter = ''
    num_consecutive = 1
    
    # Iterate over the letters in the word
    for letter in word:
        # Check if this letter has a multiplier applied
        if letter == prev_letter:
            num_consecutive += 1
        else:
            # Add previous letter's score based on its count
            if prev_letter != '':
                total_score += LETTERSCORE[prev_letter] * num_consecutive
            num_consecutive = 1
            
        # Update the previous letter and its count
        prev_letter = letter
        
    # Add last letter's score
    total_score += LETTERSCORE[prev_letter] * num_consecutive
    
    return total_score
```

To handle extensions, we can add two more parameters to the function - `multiplier` and `is_triple_word`. If `multiplier` is passed as an argument, we can multiply the total score by that amount before returning it. Similarly, if `is_triple_word` is True, we can multiply the total score by 3.


```python
def score(word, multiplier=1, is_triple_word=False):
    # Initialize variables
    total_score = 0
    prev_letter = ''
    num_consecutive = 1
    
    # Iterate over the letters in the word
    for letter in word:
        # Check if this letter has a multiplier applied
        if letter == prev_letter:
            num_consecutive += 1
        else:
            # Add previous letter's score based on its count
            if prev_letter != '':
                total_score += LETTERSCORE[prev_letter] * num_consecutive
            num_consecutive = 1
            
        # Update the previous letter and its count
        prev_letter = letter
        
    # Add last letter's score
    total_score += LETTERSCORE[prev_letter] * num_consecutive
    
    # Apply multiplier if applicable
    if multiplier > 1:
        total_score *= multiplier
        
    # Apply triple word bonus if applicable
    if is_triple_word:
        total_score *= 3
        
    return total_score
```

This implementation handles both single and multiple occurrences of the same letter, as well as the possibility of having consecutive identical letters. It also takes into account the multiplier and triple word bonuses.
