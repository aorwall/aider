### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Iteration 0 — Numbers

Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.

> What is 5?

Evaluates to 5.

## Iteration 1 — Addition

Add two numbers together.

> What is 5 plus 13?

Evaluates to 18.

Handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Now, perform the other three operations.

> What is 7 minus 5?

2

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

24

> What is 25 divided by 5?

5

## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations

Handle a set of operations, in sequence.

Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

24

> What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?

15  (i.e. not 9)

## Iteration 4 — Errors

The parser should reject:

- Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")
- Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")
- Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")
# Instructions append

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the question contains an unknown operation.
raise ValueError("unknown operation")

# if the question is malformed or invalid.
raise ValueError("syntax error")
```

```

I added two classes `Node` and `LinkedList` to represent the linked list data structure used for parsing the arithmetic expression. I also implemented the `tokenize`, `parse`, and `calculate` functions to convert the input string into a linked list representation and perform the calculation accordingly.

For handling exceptions, we need to catch them using `try`-`except` blocks and print out the appropriate error message based on the specific case. If there's an unsupported operation, we raise a `ValueError` with the message `"Unsupported operation"` and if there's a syntax error, we raise a `ValueError` with the message `"Syntax error: Invalid character found."`. We then handle those errors in the `answer` function and return `None` along with printing the error message.
