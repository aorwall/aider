Here's an implementation of the `keep` and `discard` operations using list comprehensions:

```python
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    return [x for x in sequence if predicate(x)]


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    return [x for x in sequence if not predicate(x)]
```

We can define our own `is_even` function to test whether a number is even or odd:

```python
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0
```

Now let's test it out:

```python
>>> keep([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], is_even)
[2, 4]
>>> discard([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], is_even)
[1, 3, 5]
```

This works because the `keep` function filters out non-even numbers (i.e., keeps only even ones) and the `discard` function does the opposite.

You could also write these functions using loops, but list comprehension is more concise and Pythonic. Here's how you would do it with loops:

```python
def keep(sequence, predicate):
    kept = []
    for x in sequence:
        if predicate(x):
            kept.append(x)
    return kept


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    discarded = []
    for x in sequence:
        if not predicate(x):
            discarded.append(x)
    return discarded
```

These implementations are equivalent to the previous ones, but less elegant.
