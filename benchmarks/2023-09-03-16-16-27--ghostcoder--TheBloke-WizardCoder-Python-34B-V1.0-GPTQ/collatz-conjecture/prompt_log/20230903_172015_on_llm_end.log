Here's a possible implementation for `steps` function that passes all the given tests:

```python
def steps(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be positive")
    
    count = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        count += 1
    return count
```

This implementation checks whether the input is positive and raises an error otherwise. It then uses a loop to repeatedly apply the Collatz conjecture until it reaches 1, counting how many iterations it takes.

Note that we don't need to check for odd numbers explicitly since they will always become even after one step. Also note that we use integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`) so that the result is rounded down when `n` is divided by 2. This ensures that the sequence stays within integers and doesn't produce any decimals or fractions.
