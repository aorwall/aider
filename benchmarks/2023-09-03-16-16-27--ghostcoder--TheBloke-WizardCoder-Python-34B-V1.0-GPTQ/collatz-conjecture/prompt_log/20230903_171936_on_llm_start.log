### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n.
If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2.
If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.
Repeat the process indefinitely.
The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

0. 12
1. 6
2. 3
3. 10
4. 5
5. 16
6. 8
7. 4
8. 2
9. 1

Resulting in 9 steps.
So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

The Collatz Conjecture is only concerned with **strictly positive integers**, so this exercise expects you to use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) and "throw" a `ValueError` in your solution if the given value is zero or a negative integer. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when argument is zero or a negative integer
raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: collatz_conjecture.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

### Response:
Here's the modified file with the implementation of the `steps()` function:
```python
def steps(n):
    """
    Returns the number of steps needed to reach 1 starting from a given number using the Collatz conjecture.
    If n is less than or equal to zero, raises a ValueError with the message "Only positive integers are allowed".
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    
    count = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        count += 1
    
    return count
```

We first check whether the input number is positive or not. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError` with the specified message. Otherwise, we proceed with the algorithm to find the number of steps required to reach 1 by iterating until we get to 1. We keep track of the number of iterations (count) and increment it each time we perform a step. Finally, we return the count after reaching 1.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in collatz_conjecture.py to resolve the errors.

```python
def steps(number):
    pass
