Here's the modified file with the implementation of the `steps()` function:

```python
def steps(n):
    """
    Returns the number of steps needed to reach 1 starting from a given number using the Collatz conjecture.
    If n is less than or equal to zero, raises a ValueError with the message "Only positive integers are allowed".
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    
    count = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        count += 1
    
    return count
```

We first check whether the input number is positive or not. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError` with the specified message. Otherwise, we proceed with the algorithm to find the number of steps required to reach 1 by iterating until we get to 1. We keep track of the number of iterations (count) and increment it each time we perform a step. Finally, we return the count after reaching 1.
