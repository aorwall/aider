Solution:

We can solve this problem using logic and some assumptions.

Firstly, let us create a list of all possible combinations of colors that the houses can have based on the given information.

House Colors: Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue, White (assuming white since no other color mentioned)

Now, we know that the Englishman lives in the red house, so we can eliminate all other possibilities except red for his house.

Next, we know that the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, which means if the green house is at index 2, then the ivory house must be at index 1 or 3. Similarly, if the green house is at index 3, then the ivory house must be at index 2.

Similarly, we can make more deductions based on the given clues:

- Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, he cannot live in any other house but the first one.
- If the Norwegian lives in the first house, then the person living in the third house must be the one who smokes Chesterfield because there is only one house between them.
- If the Norwegian does not live in the second house, then the owner of the pet must be the one who has the neighboring house to the Norwegian's house.
- If the Norwegian does not live in the last house, then the owner of the zebra must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who smokes Kool must live in either the second or the fourth house.
- The person who drinks milk must also be in either the second or the fourth house.
- The person who smokes Lucky Strike must be in the third or fifth house.
- The person who drinks coffee must be in the second, third or fourth house.

Using these assumptions, we can create a table of all possible combinations of people and their attributes:

| House | Nationality | Pet   | Drink     | Brand      |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1     | Norwegian |       |          |            |
| 2     |           | Dog   | Tea/Coffe | Chesterfield|
| 3     |           |       | Tea/Milk | Lucky Stick |
| 4     |           | Snail | Water    | Kool       |
| 5     |           | Fox   |          |            |

Now, we need to fill out the rest of the table. We already know that the Englishman lives in the red house, so we can mark him down as the Englishman.

Since the Spaniard owns the dog, he cannot live in the first or fifth house, otherwise the Norwegian would be next door to both the Englishman and the dog owner. Therefore, he must live in the second or fourth house.

If the Spaniard lives in the second house, then the owner of the snails must be in the fourth house, but that violates our assumption that the person who smokes Lucky Sticks must be in the third or fifth house. So, the Spaniard must live in the fourth house.

The person who drinks tea must be in the same house as the Ukranian, which means they cannot live in the first or fifth house. Also, the person who drinks tea cannot live in the third house because it conflicts with the assumption that the person who smokes Lucky Sticks must be in the third or fifth house. Hence, the Ukranian must live in the second house.

Finally, we can see that the person who smokes Kool must live in the second house, and the person who owns the fox must live in the fourth house.

Therefore, the solution is:

| House | Nationality | Pet   | Drink     | Brand      |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1     | Norwegian |       |          |            |
| 2     | Spanish   | Dog   | Tea      | Chesterfield|
| 3     | Ukranian  |       | Tea/Milk | Lucky Stick |
| 4     | Japanese | Snail | Water    | Kool       |
| 5     |           | Fox   |          |            |

So, the person who drinks water is the Norwegian, and the person who owns the Zebra is the Japanese.


Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.houses = [None]*5
        
    def add_house(self, attribute, value, position):
        self.houses[position] = {'attribute': attribute, 'value': value}
        
    def get_owner(self, attribute, value):
        for house in self.houses:
            if house['attribute'] == attribute and house['value'] == value:
                return self.houses.index(house)
        return None
    
    def drinks_water(self):
        norwegian_pos = self.get_owner('Nationality', 'Norwegian')
        for house in self.houses:
            if house['attribute'] == 'Drink' and house['value'] == 'Water':
                return self.houses.index(house) == norwegian_pos
        return False
    
    def owns_zebra(self):
        norwegian_pos = self.get_owner('Nationality', 'Norwegian')
        for house in self.houses:
            if house['attribute'] == 'Pet' and house['value'] == 'Zebra':
                return self.houses.index(house) != norwegian_pos
        return False
```

Test cases:

```python
solution = Solution()
solution.add_house('Nationality', 'Norwegian', 0)
solution.add_house('Nationality', 'Spanish', 1)
solution.add_house('Nationality', 'Ukrainian', 2)
solution.add_house('Nationality', 'Japanese', 3)
solution.add_house('Nationality', '', 4)

solution.add_house('Pet', 'Dog', 1)
solution.add_house('Pet', '', 2
