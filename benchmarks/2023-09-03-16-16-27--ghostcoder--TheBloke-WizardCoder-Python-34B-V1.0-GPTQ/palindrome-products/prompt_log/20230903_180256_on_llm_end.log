Here's the corrected implementation for `palindrome_products.py`:

```python
import math


def is_palindrome(num):
    str_num = str(num)
    return str_num == str_num[::-1]



def get_palindromic_numbers(min_factor, max_factor):
    palindromes = []
    for i in range(max_factor, min_factor - 1, -1):
        for j in range(i, min_factor - 1, -1):
            product = i * j
            if is_palindrome(product):
                palindromes.append((product, [i, j]))
    return palindromes



def largest(min_factor=1, max_factor=10):
    """Given a range of numbers, find the largest palindromes which
    are products of two numbers within that range.

    :param min_factor: int with a default value of 1
    :param max_factor: int
    :return: tuple of (palindrome, iterable).
             Iterable contains both factors of the palindrome in an arbitrary order.
    """
    palindromes = get_palindromic_numbers(min_factor, max_factor)
    if not palindromes:
        return None
    else:
        return max(palindromes)



def smallest(min_factor=1, max_factor=10):
    """Given a range of numbers, find the smallest palindromes which
    are products of two numbers within that range.

    :param min_factor: int with a default value of 1
    :param max_factor: int
    :return: tuple of (palindrome, iterable).
    Iterable contains both factors of the palindrome in an arbitrary order.
    """
    palindromes = get_palindromic_numbers(min_factor, max_factor)
    if not palindromes:
        return None
    else:
        return min(palindromes)
```

Explanation:

We added a helper function called `get_palindromic_numbers` that takes in the same parameters as `largest` and `smallest`. This function generates all possible palindromes from the given range of numbers by checking each pair of factors and appending them to a list only if they form a palindrome. We then use this helper function inside `largest` and `smallest` functions to generate the required output. If no palindromes are found, we return `None`, otherwise we return the maximum or minimum palindrome along with its factors depending on whether it's the largest or smallest palindrome. The error was caused because the original implementation didn't have any check for when there were no palindromes found in the given range, so we needed to add a condition to handle that case. Also, we changed the default values of `min_factor` to be 1 instead of 0 since we can't multiply anything by 0.
