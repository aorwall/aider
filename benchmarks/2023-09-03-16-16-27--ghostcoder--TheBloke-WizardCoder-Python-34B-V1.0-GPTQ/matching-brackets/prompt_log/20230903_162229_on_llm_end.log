Here's one possible implementation using a stack data structure:

```python
def is_paired(input_string):
    # Create a dictionary to map opening to closing brackets
    brackets_dict = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}
    
    # Initialize empty stack and iterate over input string
    stack = []
    for char in input_string:
        if char in brackets_dict:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets_dict.values():
            if len(stack) == 0 or char != brackets_dict[stack[-1]:
                return False
            else:
                stack.pop()
    
    # If all brackets were paired, stack should now be empty
    return len(stack) == 0
```

This works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., `(` or `[` or `{`), push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket (`)` or `]` or `}`), pop the last element off the stack and check whether it matches the expected closing bracket.
If it doesn't match, or if the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, return False. Otherwise, continue until the end of the string.
At the end, if the stack is still nonempty, some opening brackets were never closed, so return False. Otherwise, all brackets are paired and properly nested, so return True.
