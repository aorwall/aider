### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched and nested correctly.
The string may also contain other characters, which for the purposes of this exercise should be ignored.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matching_brackets.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: matching_brackets.py
```python
def is_paired(input_string):
    pass
