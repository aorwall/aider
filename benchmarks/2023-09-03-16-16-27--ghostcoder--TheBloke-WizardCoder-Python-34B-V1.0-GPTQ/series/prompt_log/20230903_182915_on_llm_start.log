### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```


### Instruction:
# Instructions

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;
the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the slice length is zero.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")

# if the slice length is negative.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")

# if the series provided is empty.
raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

# if the slice length is longer than the series.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")
```

### Response:
Here's the modified solution for the given problem:
Filepath: series.py
```
def slices(series, length):
    """
    Returns all possible substrings of given length from the input series.
    If the series or length parameter is invalid, raises a ValueError with appropriate message.
    
    Args:
        series (str): A non-empty string consisting of decimal digits.
        length (int): An integer representing the desired substring length.
    
    Returns:
        list[str]: List of all possible substrings of specified length from the input series.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If either series or length is empty or out of range.
    """
    # Check if series is valid
    if len(series) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Series cannot be empty.")
    elif length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length must be positive.")
    elif length > len(series):
        raise ValueError("Length cannot be greater than series length.")
    else:
        return [series[i: i+length] for i in range(len(series)-length+1)]

```

We first check whether the series is empty or has a length less than or equal to zero, which would result in no possible substrings being generated. We also check if the requested length is greater than the length of the series itself, which would cause an IndexError when trying to access beyond the bounds of the series. In such cases we raise a ValueError with an appropriate message. Otherwise, we generate all possible substrings using a list comprehension by iterating over each starting index up to the maximum number of indices available and returning a substring of the specified length starting at that index.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in series.py to resolve the errors.
