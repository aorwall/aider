Here's the modified solution for the given problem:

```python
def slices(series, length):
    """
    Returns all possible substrings of given length from the input series.
    If the series or length parameter is invalid, raises a ValueError with appropriate message.
    
    Args:
        series (str): A non-empty string consisting of decimal digits.
        length (int): An integer representing the desired substring length.
    
    Returns:
        list[str]: List of all possible substrings of specified length from the input series.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If either series or length is empty or out of range.
    """
    # Check if series is valid
    if len(series) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Series cannot be empty.")
    elif length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length must be positive.")
    elif length > len(series):
        raise ValueError("Length cannot be greater than series length.")
    else:
        return [series[i: i+length] for i in range(len(series)-length+1)]
```

We first check whether the series is empty or has a length less than or equal to zero, which would result in no possible substrings being generated. We also check if the requested length is greater than the length of the series itself, which would cause an IndexError when trying to access beyond the bounds of the series. In such cases we raise a ValueError with an appropriate message. Otherwise, we generate all possible substrings using a list comprehension by iterating over each starting index up to the maximum number of indices available and returning a substring of the specified length starting at that index.
