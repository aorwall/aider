Here's the modified version of the provided file:

```python
def classify(number):
    """ A perfect number equals the sum of its positive divisors.
    
    :param number: int a positive integer
    :return: str the classification of the input integer
    """
    # Raise a value error if the input is not a positive integer greater than zero
    if not isinstance(number, int) or number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    aliquot_sum = sum([i for i in range(1, number//2 + 1) if number % i == 0])
    if aliquot_sum < number:
        return 'deficient'
    elif aliquot_sum > number:
        return 'abundant'
    else:
        return 'perfect'
```

We added a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input is a positive integer greater than zero. If it isn't, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message. We then calculate the aliquot sum using a list comprehension and check if it's equal to, less than, or greater than the input number to determine if it's perfect, abundant, or deficient respectively. Note that we divide by two instead of iterating up to the square root of the number because it's faster (since factors come in pairs after the square root).
