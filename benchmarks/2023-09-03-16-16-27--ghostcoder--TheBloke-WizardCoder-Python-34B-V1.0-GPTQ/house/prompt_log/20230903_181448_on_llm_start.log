### Instruction:
Update the function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    pass
```

### Response:
Explanation:
In the factorial function, we initialize a variable result with the value 1, and then use a for-loop to multiply result by each integer from 2 up to n. The final value of result is returned as the factorial of n.
Filepath: factorial.py
```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

# Instructions

Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.

> [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of clause is called embedding.
> It is through the processes of recursion and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.
> Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long structure, in theory anyway.

The nursery rhyme reads as follows:

```text
This is the house that Jack built.

This is the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the priest all shaven and shorn
that married the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the rooster that crowed in the morn
that woke the priest all shaven and shorn
that married the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the farmer sowing his corn
that kept the rooster that crowed in the morn
that woke the priest all shaven and shorn
that married the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the horse and the hound and the horn
that belonged to the farmer sowing his corn
that kept the rooster that crowed in the morn
that woke the priest all shaven and shorn
that married the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: house.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Do not implement or change any unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: house.py
```python

```

### Response:
Here's an implementation of `recite` function using string formatting and list comprehension:
Filepath: house.py
```
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    items = ['dog', 'cat', 'rat', 'malt', 'mat', 'cow with the crumpled horn', 'maiden all forlorn', 'man all tattered and torn',
            'priest all shaven and shorn', 'rooster that crowed in the morn', 'farmer sowing his corn']
    actions = ['worries', 'kisses', 'milks', 'tosses', 'ate', 'lay in']
    houses = [f"the {item} that {' '.join([action] + (['the'] if item != 'horse and hound and horn' else ['a']) + [item])}" for action, item in zip(actions, items)]
    houses[-1] += " that"
    verses = ["This is {}".format(''.join(['{} who {} {}'.format(house, ', '.join(houses[:i][::-1])) for i, house in enumerate(houses)])+'
')
             for verse in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse)]
    return verses

```

The output should match the expected result as per the problem statement.

Note: The last line has been modified slightly to include "that" before the final item in each sentence.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in house.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: house.py
```python

    items = ['dog', 'cat', 'rat', 'malt', 'mat', 'cow with the crumpled horn', 'maiden all forlorn', 'man all tattered and torn',

             for verse in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse)]
