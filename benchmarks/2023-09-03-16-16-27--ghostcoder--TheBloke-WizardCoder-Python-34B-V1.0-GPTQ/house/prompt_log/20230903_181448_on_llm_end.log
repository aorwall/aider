Here's an implementation of `recite` function using string formatting and list comprehension:

```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    items = ['dog', 'cat', 'rat', 'malt', 'mat', 'cow with the crumpled horn', 'maiden all forlorn', 'man all tattered and torn',
            'priest all shaven and shorn', 'rooster that crowed in the morn', 'farmer sowing his corn']
    actions = ['worries', 'kisses', 'milks', 'tosses', 'ate', 'lay in']
    houses = [f"the {item} that {' '.join([action] + (['the'] if item != 'horse and hound and horn' else ['a']) + [item])}" for action, item in zip(actions, items)]
    houses[-1] += " that"
    verses = ["This is {}".format(''.join(['{} who {} {}'.format(house, ', '.join(houses[:i][::-1])) for i, house in enumerate(houses)])+'\n')
             for verse in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse)]
    return verses
```

The output should match the expected result as per the problem statement.

Note: The last line has been modified slightly to include "that" before the final item in each sentence.
