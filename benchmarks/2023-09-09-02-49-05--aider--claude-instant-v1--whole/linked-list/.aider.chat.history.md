#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You are working on a project to develop a train scheduling system for a busy railway network.  
####   
#### You've been asked to develop a prototype for the train routes in the scheduling system.  
#### Each route consists of a sequence of train stations that a given train stops at.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your team has decided to use a doubly linked list to represent each train route in the schedule.  
#### Each station along the train's route will be represented by a node in the linked list.  
####   
#### You don't need to worry about arrival and departure times at the stations.  
#### Each station will simply be represented by a number.  
####   
#### Routes can be extended, adding stations to the beginning or end of a route.  
#### They can also be shortened by removing stations from the beginning or the end of a route.  
####   
#### Sometimes a station gets closed down, and in that case the station needs to be removed from the route, even if it is not at the beginning or end of the route.  
####   
#### The size of a route is measured not by how far the train travels, but by how many stations it stops at.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.  
#### As the name suggests, it is a list of nodes that are linked together.  
#### It is a list of "nodes", where each node links to its neighbor or neighbors.  
#### In a **singly linked list** each node links only to the node that follows it.  
#### In a **doubly linked list** each node links to both the node that comes before, as well as the node that comes after.  
####   
#### If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## How this Exercise is Structured in Python  
####   
#### While linked lists can be implemented in a variety of ways with a variety of underlying data structures, we ask here that you implement your linked list in an OOP fashion.  
####   
#### In the stub file, you will see the start of a `Node` class, as well as a `LinkedList` class.  
#### Your `Node` class should keep track of its value, as well as which other nodes preceed or follow.  
#### Your `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and the special method for `len` should be implemented in the `LinkedList` class.  
#### You might also find it useful to implement a special `iter` method for iteration.  
####   
#### Unlike the core exercise, we will be testing error conditions by calling `pop` and `shift` on empty `LinkedLists`, so you will need to `raise` errors appropriately.  
####   
#### Finally, we would like you to implement `delete` in addition to the methods outlined above.  
#### `delete` will take one argument, which is the value to be removed from the linked list.  
#### If the value appears more than once, only the **first** occurrence should be removed.  
####   
#### <br>  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising]. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.  
#### This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.  
#### For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][error types], but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise] to "throw" a `ValueError` when a node value being `delete()`-ed is not found in the linked list.  
#### Additionally, an `IndexError` should be thrown if there are no nodes left to `pop()`.  
#### The tests will only pass if you both `raise` these `exceptions` and include messages with them.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # When the value passed to `delete()` is not found.  
#### if not found:  
####     raise ValueError("Value not found")  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### To raise an `IndexError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # When pop() is called and there are no nodes left in the linked list  
#### if self.length == 0:  
####     raise IndexError("List is empty")  
####   
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### ## Special Methods in Python  
####   
#### The tests for this exercise will also be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.  
#### In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.  
#### For details on implementing special or "dunder" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.__len__(self)][__len__].  
####   
#### We also recommend creating a special [`__iter__`][__iter__] method to help with iterating over your linked list.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: linked_list.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
