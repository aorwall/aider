#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.  
####   
#### Your team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.  
#### That can cause all sorts of havoc.  
####   
#### But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.  
####   
#### This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.  
####   
#### Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).  
####   
#### The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).  
####   
#### Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:  
####   
#### - `G` -> `C`  
#### - `C` -> `G`  
#### - `T` -> `A`  
#### - `A` -> `U`  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### If you want to look at how the inputs and outputs are structured, take a look at the examples in the test suite.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rna_transcription.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

rna_transcription.py
```python
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    rna = ""
    for nucleotide in dna_strand:
        if nucleotide == "G":
            rna += "C"
        elif nucleotide == "C":
            rna += "G" 
        elif nucleotide == "T":
            rna += "A"
        elif nucleotide == "A":
            rna += "U"
    return rna
```
