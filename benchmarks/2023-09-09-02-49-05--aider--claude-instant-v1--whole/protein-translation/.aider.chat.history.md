#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Translate RNA sequences into proteins.  
####   
#### RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCU"` => translates to  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU"`  
#### => which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  
#### If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.  
#### However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.  
####   
#### There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.  
####   
#### All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG"` =>  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAA", "AUG"` =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### Note the stop codon `"UAA"` terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.  
####   
#### Below are the codons and resulting Amino Acids needed for the exercise.  
####   
#### Codon                 | Protein  
#### :---                  | :---  
#### AUG                   | Methionine  
#### UUU, UUC              | Phenylalanine  
#### UUA, UUG              | Leucine  
#### UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG    | Serine  
#### UAU, UAC              | Tyrosine  
#### UGU, UGC              | Cysteine  
#### UGG                   | Tryptophan  
#### UAA, UAG, UGA         | STOP  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: protein_translation.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is my suggested update to the protein_translation.py file to implement the protein translation functionality:

protein_translation.py
```python
codon_table = {
  'AUG': 'Methionine',  
  'UUU': 'Phenylalanine',
  'UUC': 'Phenylalanine',
  'UUA': 'Leucine',
  'UUG': 'Leucine',
  'UCU': 'Serine',
  'UCC': 'Serine', 
  'UCA': 'Serine',
  'UCG': 'Serine',
  'UAU': 'Tyrosine',
  'UAC': 'Tyrosine',
  'UGU': 'Cysteine',
  'UGC': 'Cysteine',
  'UGG': 'Tryptophan',
  'UAA': 'STOP',
  'UAG': 'STOP',
  'UGA': 'STOP'
}

def proteins(rna):
  proteins = []
  i = 0
  while i < len(rna):
    codon = rna[i:i+3]
    if codon in codon_table:
      if codon_table[codon] == 'STOP':
        return proteins
      else:
        proteins.append(codon_table[codon])
      i += 3
    else:
      return "Invalid codon encountered"
  return proteins
```

This implements the protein translation by:

1. Defining a codon table dictionary to map codons to amino acids 
2. Iterating through the RNA string in codons of 3 characters
3. Looking up the codon in the table and appending to a proteins list
4. Checking for stop codons and returning early
5. Returning the proteins list

Let me know if any part needs more explanation or modification to meet the requirements.
