#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.  
####   
#### [Darts][darts] is a game where players throw darts at a [target][darts-target].  
####   
#### In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:  
####   
#### ![Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/darts/darts-scoreboard.svg)  
####   
#### - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).  
#### - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.  
#### - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.  
#### - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.  
####   
#### The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.  
#### Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are [concentric][] defined by the coordinates (0, 0).  
####   
#### Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its [Cartesian coordinates][cartesian-coordinates] `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are [real][real-numbers]), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: darts.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated file with the function to score a dart toss based on its coordinates:

darts.py
```python
import math

def score(x, y):
    distance_from_center = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    if distance_from_center > 10:
        return 0
    elif distance_from_center > 5: 
        return 1
    elif distance_from_center > 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
```

This function takes the Cartesian coordinates x and y of where the dart landed as arguments. It calculates the distance from the center (0,0) using the Pythagorean theorem. Then it checks which scoring zone the distance falls in and returns the appropriate point value:

- If the distance is greater than 10, it is outside the target so returns 0 
- If the distance is greater than 5 but less than 10, it is in the outer circle so returns 1
- If the distance is greater than 1 but less than 5, it is in the middle circle so returns 5
- If the distance is less than or equal to 1, it is in the inner circle so returns 10

This implements the scoring logic described in the instructions using only standard Python libraries as requested. Let me know if any part needs more explanation or if you have additional requirements.
