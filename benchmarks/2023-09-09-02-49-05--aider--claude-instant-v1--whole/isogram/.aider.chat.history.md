#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.  
####   
#### An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.  
####   
#### Examples of isograms:  
####   
#### - lumberjacks  
#### - background  
#### - downstream  
#### - six-year-old  
####   
#### The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: isogram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.replace(" ", "").replace("-", "").lower()
    for char in string:
        if string.count(char) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This file listing updates the isogram.py file to implement the is_isogram function based on the provided instructions. It removes spaces and hyphens from the input string, converts it to lowercase, then loops through each character counting how many times it appears. If any character count is greater than 1, it returns False. Otherwise it returns True after fully checking the string.
