#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.  
####   
#### A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  
####   
#### Note that 1 is not a prime number.  
####   
#### ## Example  
####   
#### What are the prime factors of 60?  
####   
#### - Our first divisor is 2.  
####   2 goes into 60, leaving 30.  
#### - 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.  
####   - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.  
####     So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.  
#### - 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.  
####   - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 4.  
####   - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 5.  
#### - 5 does go cleanly into 5.  
#### - We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.  
####   
#### Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.  
####   
#### You can check this yourself:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 2 * 2 * 3 * 5  
#### = 4 * 15  
#### = 60  
#### ```  
####   
#### Success!  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: prime_factors.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

prime_factors.py
```python
import math

def factors(value):
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while divisor <= math.sqrt(value):
        if value % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            value //= divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1
    if value > 1:
        factors.append(value)
    return factors
```

This implements the prime factor algorithm as described in the instructions. It starts with divisor=2 and checks if it divides the input value cleanly. If so it adds the divisor to the factors list and divides the value. It continues with successive integers as divisors until the value is 1, collecting all prime factors along the way.
