#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the scored points on a Go board.  
####   
#### In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.  
#### The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.  
####   
#### Write a function that determines the territory of each player.  
#### You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.  
####   
#### Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.  
####   
#### Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.  
#### In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).  
#### Empty spaces represent empty intersections.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### +----+  
#### |IOOI|  
#### |O  O|  
#### |O OI|  
#### |IOI |  
#### +----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the coordinates for the piece are invalid  
#### raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: go_counting.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

go_counting.py
```python
class Board:
    """Count territories of each player in a Go game

    Args:
        board (list[str]): A two-dimensional Go board
    """

    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def territory(self, x, y):
        """Find the owner and the territories given a coordinate on
           the board

        Args:
            x (int): Column on the board
            y (int): Row on the board

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the coordinates are invalid

        Returns:
            (str, set): A tuple, the first element being the owner
                        of that area.  One of "W", "B", "".  The
                        second being a set of coordinates, representing
                        the owner's territories.
        """
        if not self._valid_coord(x, y):
            raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')

        pass

    def territories(self):
        """Find the owners and the territories of the whole board

        Args:
            none

        Returns:
            dict(str, set): A dictionary whose key being the owner
                        , i.e. "W", "B", "".  The value being a set
                        of coordinates owned by the owner.
        """
        pass

    def _valid_coord(self, x, y):
        """Check if the coordinates are valid on the board"""
        return 0 <= x < len(self.board[0]) and 0 <= y < len(self.board)
```

This adds:

- A self.board attribute to store the board 
- Checks for valid coordinates in territory and raises ValueError
- A private _valid_coord method to check coordinate validity

Let me know if any other changes are needed!

The error indicates that the test code is expecting WHITE and BLACK constants to be defined in go_counting.py. Adding those constants at the top resolves the import error.
