#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.  
####   
#### Given the collection of numbers:  
####   
#### - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
####   
#### And the operation:  
####   
#### - square a number (`x => x * x`)  
####   
#### Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:  
####   
#### - 1, 4, 9, 16, 25  
####   
#### Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.  
####   
#### ## Restrictions  
####   
#### Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality provided by your standard library!  
#### Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: accumulate.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

accumulate.py
```python
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    result = []
    for item in collection:
        result.append(operation(item))
    return result
```

> Applied edit to accumulate.py  
```
