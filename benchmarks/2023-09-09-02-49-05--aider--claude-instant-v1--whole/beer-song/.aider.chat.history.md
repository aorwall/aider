        verses.append(verse)
        verse = f"Take one down and pass it around, {next_bottles} {bottle} of beer on the wall."
        verses.append(verse)
        
    if bottles == 0:
        last_verse = "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer."
        verses.append(last_verse)
        last_verse = "Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
        verses.append(last_verse)
        
    return "\n".join(verses)
```

The key changes:

1. Range goes from start to -1 instead of 0 to catch the last bottle.

2. Verses are built and appended separately to avoid concatenation issues.

3. Last verse logic is moved inside the for loop to handle bottles reaching 0.

Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
