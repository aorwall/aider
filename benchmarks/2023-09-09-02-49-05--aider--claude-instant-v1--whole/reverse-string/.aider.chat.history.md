#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Reverse a string  
####   
#### For example:  
#### input: "cool"  
#### output: "looc"  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: reverse_string.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

reverse_string.py
```python
def reverse(text):
  return text[::-1]
```

This file listing contains the updated content for the reverse_string.py file to implement reversing a string based on the instructions. 

The existing function stub def reverse(text): is kept. To reverse a string in Python, slicing syntax [start:end:step] is used with a step of -1. This reverses the order of the characters in the string and returns the result.

No additional packages need to be installed, this uses only standard Python libraries as requested. Please let me know if any part of the explanation or code changes need clarification.

> Applied edit to reverse_string.py
