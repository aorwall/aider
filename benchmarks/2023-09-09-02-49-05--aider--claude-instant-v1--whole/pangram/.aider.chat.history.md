#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.  
#### They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.  
#### To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.  
#### You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".  
####   
#### The best known English pangram is:

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.  
####   
#### A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.  
#### It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).  
####   
#### For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated pangram.py file:

pangram.py
```python
import string

def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for letter in alphabet:
        if letter not in sentence.lower():
            return False
    return True
```

This updates the pangram.py file to implement the is_pangram function as follows:

- Import the string library to get the ascii lowercase alphabet 
- Define the alphabet as a string of all lowercase letters
- Loop through each letter in the alphabet
- Check if that letter is in the lowercase version of the input sentence using in
- If any letter is not found, return False immediately
- If all letters are found, return True after the loop completes

This implements the function using only standard Python libraries as requested, checking if a sentence contains all letters of the English alphabet and is therefore a pangram. Let me know if any part of the implementation needs further explanation or modification.
