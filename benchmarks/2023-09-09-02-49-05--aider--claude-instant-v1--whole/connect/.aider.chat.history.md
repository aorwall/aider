#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.  
####

####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def get_winner(self):
        board = self.board
        rows = len(board)
        cols = len(board[0])

        # Check for horizontal connection
        for r in range(rows):
            piece = board[r][0]
            if piece != '.':
                connected = True
                for c in range(cols):
                    if board[r][c] != piece:
                        connected = False
                        break
                if connected:
                    return piece

        # Check for vertical connection 
        for c in range(cols):
            piece = board[0][c]
            if piece != '.':
                connected = True
                for r in range(rows):
                    if board[r][c] != piece:
                        connected = False
                        break 
                if connected:
                    return piece

        # No winner found
        return None
```

This implements the basic logic to check for a horizontal or vertical connection on the board to determine a winner. It iterates through each row and column, checking that all cells in that row/column contain the same piece. If a full connection is found, it returns the winning piece. If no connections are found, it returns None.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct.  
#### Fix the code in connect.py to resolve the errors.  

connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def get_winner(self):
        board = self.board
        rows = len(board) 
        cols = len(board[0])

        # Check for horizontal connection
        for r in range(rows):
            piece = board[r][0]
            if piece != '.':
                connected = True
                for c in range(cols):
                    if board[r][c] != piece:
                        connected = False
                        break
                if connected:
                    return piece

        # Check for vertical connection
        for c in range(cols):
            piece = board[0][c] 
            if piece != '.':
                connected = True
                for r in range(rows):
                    if board[r][c] != piece:
                        connected = False
                        break
                if connected: 
                    return piece

        # Check for diagonal connections
        for r in range(rows-1):
            for c in range(cols-1):
                piece = board[r][c]
                if piece != '.':
                    if (board[r][c] == board[r+1][c+1] or 
                        board[r][c] == board[r+1][c-1]):
                        return piece

        # No winner found
        return ""
```

This adds a check for diagonal connections to resolve the test failures. Let me know if any other changes are needed!
