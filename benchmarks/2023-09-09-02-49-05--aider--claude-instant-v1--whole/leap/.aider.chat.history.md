#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a year, report if it is a leap year.  
####   
#### The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### on every year that is evenly divisible by 4  
####   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100  
####     unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  
#### 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!  
####   
#### For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

leap.py
```python
def leap_year(year):
  if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
      if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
      else:
        return False
    else: 
      return True
  else:
    return False
```
