#### # Instructions  
####   
#### For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.  
#### This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.  
#### These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.  
#### You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.  
#### You do this six times, once for each ability.  
####   
#### Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.  
#### You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.  
####   
#### Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.  
####   
#### For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:  
####   
#### - 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.  
#### - 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.  
#### - 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.  
#### - 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.  
#### - 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.  
#### - 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.  
####   
#### Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.  
#### One such language is [Troll][troll].

#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:

    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability() 
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()

        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.calculate_hitpoints()

    def roll_ability(self):
        rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(4)]
        rolls.sort(reverse=True)
        return sum(rolls[:3])

    def calculate_hitpoints(self):
        constitution = self.constitution
        if constitution >= 10:
            return 0
        return int((constitution - 10) / 2)
```

This implements the character generation process described. It uses the Python random module to randomly generate 4 dice rolls for each ability score, sorts them descending, and sums the largest 3 as per the rules. 

It calculates hitpoints by getting the character's constitution attribute, subtracting 10, dividing by 2, and rounding down as an integer as specified to get the constitution modifier. This is then returned and added to the base 10 hitpoints.

Let me know if any part of the implementation needs further explanation or modification!

dnd-character/dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:

    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability() 
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability()
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability() 
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()

        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.calculate_hitpoints()

    def roll_ability(self):
        rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(4)]
        rolls.sort(reverse=True)
        return sum(rolls[:3])

    def calculate_hitpoints(self):
        constitution = self.constitution
        modifier = self.get_modifier(constitution)
        return int(10 + modifier)

    def get_modifier(self, ability_score):
        if ability_score >= 10:
            return 0
        return int((ability_score - 10) / 2)
```

The error indicates that the test code is expecting a 'modifier' attribute or method on the Character class, but it is not defined. Adding the get_modifier method resolves the import error by defining what the test code is expecting.
