#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a tree building algorithm.  
####   
#### Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.  
#### However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.  
#### Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.  
####   
#### Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.  
#### The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.  
#### The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).  
#### All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.  
####   
#### An example tree:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)  
#### |-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)  
#### |    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)  
#### +-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)  
#### +-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

tree_building.py
```python
from typing import List

class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id: int, parent_id: int):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id

class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id: int):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children: List[Node] = []

def build_tree(records: List[Record]) -> Node:
    if not records:
        raise ValueError("No records provided")

    nodes = {}
    root = None

    # Validate records
    max_id = max(r.record_id for r in records)
    if max_id != len(records) - 1:
        raise ValueError("Record IDs are not consecutive")

    for record in records:
        if record.record_id < 0 or record.record_id >= len(records):
            raise ValueError("Record ID out of bounds")
        if record.parent_id < 0 or record.parent_id >= record.record_id:
            raise ValueError("Parent ID invalid for record")

    # Build nodes
    for record in records:
        node = Node(record.record_id)
        nodes[record.record_id] = node

    # Assign parents    
    for record in records:
        parent_node = nodes.get(record.parent_id)
        if not parent_node:
            raise ValueError(f"No parent node for record {record}")
        parent_node.children.append(nodes[record.record_id])

    # Find root    
    for node in nodes.values():
        if node.node_id == 0:
            root = node
            break
        if not root:
            raise ValueError("Root node not found")

    return root
```

This refactors the tree building logic to:

- Add type hints for clarity
- Validate record data upfront 
- Build nodes dictionary for easy access
- Find parent nodes by ID
- Return early on errors with clear messages

Let me know if any part needs more explanation!

       if not root:
           raise ValueError("Root node not found")

    return root
```

The error was caused by the function name 'build_tree' not matching what was being imported in the test file. Renaming it to 'BuildTree' to match the import resolves the error.
