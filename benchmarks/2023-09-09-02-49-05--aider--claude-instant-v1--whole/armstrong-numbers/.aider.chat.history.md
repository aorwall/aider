#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An [Armstrong number][armstrong-number] is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`  
#### - 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`  
#### - 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`  
#### - 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`  
####   
#### Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: armstrong_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

armstrong_numbers.py
```python
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    number_str = str(number)
    length = len(number_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in number_str:
        sum += int(digit)**length
    return sum == number
```

This file listing contains an updated implementation of the is_armstrong_number function in the armstrong_numbers.py file based on the provided instructions. 

The function first converts the number to a string, to access each digit. It calculates the length of the digit string to determine the exponent to raise each digit to. It initializes a sum variable to 0. 

Then it iterates through each digit character in the string, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of the length and adds it to the running sum. 

Finally it returns whether the final sum equals the original number, determining if it is an Armstrong number.

This implements the algorithm described without using any additional packages beyond the standard Python library.
