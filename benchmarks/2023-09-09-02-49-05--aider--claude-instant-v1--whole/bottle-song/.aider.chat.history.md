#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.  
####   
#### Note that not all verses are identical.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start=10, take=1):
    verses = [
        "Ten green bottles hanging on the wall, Ten green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Nine green bottles hanging on the wall, Nine green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Eight green bottles hanging on the wall, Eight green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Seven green bottles hanging on the wall, Seven green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Six green bottles hanging on the wall, Six green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Five green bottles hanging on the wall, Five green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Four green bottles hanging on the wall, Four green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Three green bottles hanging on the wall, Three green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.",
        "Two green bottles hanging on the wall, Two green bottles hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.",
        "One green bottle hanging on the wall, One green bottle hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall."
    ]
    
    for i in range(start-take, start-1, -1):
        print(verses[i-1])
```

This modifies the bottle_song.py file to implement the recite function as requested. It defines a list containing the lyrics for each verse, then loops through and prints the appropriate verse based on the start and take parameters.

        "One green bottle hanging on the wall, One green bottle hanging on the wall, And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall."
    ]
    
    result = []
    for i in range(start-take, start):
        result.append(verses[i-1])
    return result
```

The issue was that the function was not returning the list of verses. I have updated it to store the verses in a result list and return that list at the end.
