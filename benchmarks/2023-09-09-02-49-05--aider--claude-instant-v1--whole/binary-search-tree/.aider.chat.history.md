#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.  
####   
#### When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.  
####   
#### Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.  
#### Now we must sort the entire array again!  
#### We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.  
#### But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.  
####   
#### Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.  
####   
#### A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.  
#### Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.  
#### The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.  
#### Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.  
#### All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.  
####   
#### For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      /  
####     2  
####   
#### If we then added 6, it would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      / \  
####     2   6  
####   
#### If we then added 3, it would look like this  
####   
####        4  
####      /   \  
####     2     6  
####      \  
####       3  
####   
#### And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this  
####   
####           4  
####         /   \  
####        /     \  
####       2       6  
####      / \     / \  
####     1   3   5   7  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search_tree.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

binary_search_tree.py
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return f'TreeNode(data={self.data}, left={self.left}, right={self.right})'


class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self, tree_data):
        self.root = None
        for data in tree_data:
            self.insert(data)

    def insert(self, data):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = TreeNode(data)
            return

        current = self.root
        while True:
            if data < current.data:
                if current.left:
                    current = current.left
                else:
                    current.left = TreeNode(data)
                    break
            else:
                if current.right:
                    current = current.right
                else:
                    current.right = TreeNode(data)
                    break

    def data(self):
        return self._traverse(self.root, [])

    def _traverse(self, current, nodes):
        if current:
            self._traverse(current.left, nodes)
            nodes.append(current.data)
            self._traverse(current.right, nodes)
        return nodes

    def sorted_data(self):
        return sorted(self.data())
```

This implements the basic functionality of a binary search tree as described in the instructions. The BinarySearchTree class now initializes with a list of data to insert into the tree. The insert method recursively searches for the correct location to add each new node. Data and sorted_data traverse the tree to return the values.

binary_search_tree.py
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left 
        self.right = right

        for data in tree_data:
            self.insert(data)

    def insert(self, data):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = TreeNode(data)
            return

        current = self.root
        while True:
            if data < current.data:
                if current.left:
                    current = current.left
                else:
                    current.left = TreeNode(data)
                    break
            else: 
                if current.right:
                    current = current.right
                else:
                    current.right = TreeNode(data)
                    break

    def data(self):
        return self._traverse(self.root)

    def _traverse(self, current):
        if current:
            self._traverse(current.left)
            print(current.data)
            self._traverse(current.right)
```

The issue was that data() was returning a list, but the tests were expecting a BinarySearchTree object to call data on. By removing the unnecessary list, and just traversing and printing the nodes, the tests should now pass.
