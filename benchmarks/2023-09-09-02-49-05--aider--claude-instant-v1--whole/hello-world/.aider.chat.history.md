#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The classical introductory exercise.  
#### Just say "Hello, World!".  
####   
#### ["Hello, World!"][hello-world] is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.  
####   
#### The objectives are simple:  
####   
#### - Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".  
#### - Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.  
#### - Submit your solution and check it at the website.  
####   
#### If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.  
####   
#### [hello-world]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hello_world.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is the updated file with the suggested code changes:

hello_world.py
```python
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

To complete the objective of modifying the code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!", I have simply changed the return value of the existing hello() function from 'Goodbye, Mars!' to 'Hello, World!'. No other changes were needed to the code structure or files. Running the test suite should now succeed as the function produces the expected output.

> Applied edit to hello_world.py
