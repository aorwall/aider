#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage a game player's High Score list.  
####   
#### Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.  
#### Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.  
####   
#### - [**Data Structures (Python 3 Documentation Tutorial)**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)  
#### - [**Lists and Tuples in Python (Real Python)**](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)  
#### - [**Python Lists (Google for Education)**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: high_scores.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def get_highest_score(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def get_last_added_score(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def get_top_three_scores(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

This makes the following changes to high_scores.py:

1. Added a `self.scores` attribute to store the list of scores passed to the initializer.

2. Implemented the `get_highest_score` method to return the maximum score in `self.scores` using the built-in `max()` function. 

3. Implemented the `get_last_added_score` method to return the last element in `self.scores` using negative indexing.

4. Implemented the `get_top_three_scores` method to return the top 3 scores by sorting the list in reverse order and slicing the first 3 elements.

This implements the requested functionality of returning various score values from the list while keeping the existing class and method stubs. Only standard Python libraries are used without any additional packages.

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct.  
#### Fix the code in high_scores.py to resolve the errors.  

high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def get_highest_score(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def get_last_added_score(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def get_top_three_scores(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]

    def personal_best(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```

The errors indicate that the HighScores class is missing methods called by the tests:

- personal_best() 
- personal_top_three()

Adding implementations of these methods that simply return the highest score and top 3 scores respectively should resolve the test failures.

No other changes are needed to the existing code. The tests are validating the required interface, so just implementing the missing methods as indicated above allows the tests to pass.
