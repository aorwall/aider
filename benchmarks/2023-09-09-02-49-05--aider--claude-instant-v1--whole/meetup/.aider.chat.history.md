#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recurring monthly meetups are generally scheduled on the given weekday of a given week each month.  
#### In this exercise you will be given the recurring schedule, along with a month and year, and then asked to find the exact date of the meetup.  
####   
#### For example a meetup might be scheduled on the _first Monday_ of every month.  
#### You might then be asked to find the date that this meetup will happen in January 2018.  
#### In other words, you need to determine the date of the first Monday of January 2018.  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
####   
#### The descriptors you are expected to process are: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### Note that descriptor `teenth` is a made-up word.  
####   
#### It refers to the seven numbers that end in '-teen' in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  
#### But general descriptions of dates use ordinal numbers, e.g. the _first_ Monday, the _third_ Tuesday.  
####   
#### For the numbers ending in '-teen', that becomes:  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### So there are seven numbers ending in '-teen'.  
#### And there are also seven weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).  
#### Therefore, it is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one numbered day ending with "teen" each month.  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953 (or, alternately the "Saturteenth" of August, 1953), we need to look at the calendar for August 1953:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### The Saturday that has a number ending in '-teen' is August 15, 1953.

####   
#### ## Customizing and Raising Exceptions  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.  
####   
#### Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).  
####   
#### For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.  
####   
#### To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException  
#### class MeetupDayException(ValueError):  
####     """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.  
####   
####     message: explanation of the error.  
####   
####     """  
####     def __init__(self, message):  
####         self.message = message  
####   
####           
#### # raising a MeetupDayException  
#### raise MeetupDayException("That day does not exist.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
