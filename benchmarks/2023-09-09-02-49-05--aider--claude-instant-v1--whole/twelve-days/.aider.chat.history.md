#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Test-driven development  
####   
####  Be sure to check the comments at the top of the tests file.  
####  They will be helpful in understanding the expected output of your function.  
####   
#### This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.  
#### However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.  
#### For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.  
#### For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.  
#### What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?  
####   
#### [cumulative song]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve_days.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here is an updated twelve_days.py file with code to recite the lyrics of "The Twelve Days of Christmas":

twelve_days.py
```python
gifts = [
  "a Partridge in a Pear Tree",
  "two Turtle Doves", 
  "three French Hens",
  "four Calling Birds",
  "five Gold Rings",
  "six Geese-a-Laying",
  "seven Swans-a-Swimming",
  "eight Maids-a-Milking",
  "nine Ladies Dancing",
  "ten Lords-a-Leaping",
  "eleven Pipers Piping",
  "twelve Drummers Drumming"
]

all_gifts = "and a Partridge in a Pear Tree"

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
  verses = ""
  for verse in range(start_verse, end_verse+1):
    day = "On the " + str(verse) + " day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
    gifts = ", ".join(gifts[(verse-1)-1::-1])
    if verse < len(gifts):
      gifts += ", "
    gifts += all_gifts
    verses += day + gifts + "\n"
  return verses
```

This builds each verse by:

- Looping from the start to end verse
- Getting the day string  
- Joining the list of gifts in reverse order
- Adding the "all gifts" string
- Adding newlines

Let me know if any part needs more explanation!

twelve_days.py
```python
gifts = [
  "a Partridge in a Pear Tree", 
  "two Turtle Doves",
  "three French Hens",
  "four Calling Birds",
  "five Gold Rings",
  "six Geese-a-Laying",
  "seven Swans-a-Swimming",
  "eight Maids-a-Milking",
  "nine Ladies Dancing",
  "ten Lords-a-Leaping",
  "eleven Pipers Piping",
  "twelve Drummers Drumming"
]

all_gifts = "and a Partridge in a Pear Tree"

def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
  verses = ""
  for verse in range(start_verse, end_verse+1):
    day = f"On the {verse} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
    gifts_list = gifts[(verse-1)-1::-1] 
    gifts = ", ".join(gifts_list)
    if verse < len(gifts):
      gifts += ", "
    gifts += all_gifts
    verses += day + gifts + "\n"
  return verses
```

The issue was that gifts was being referenced before it was defined within the function scope. Making gifts a global variable avoids this by defining it at the module level before the function. An alternative would be to pass gifts as a parameter to the function.
