#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  
####   
#### Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets.  
#### They start with prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public keys, and then generate a shared secret key.  
####   
#### ## Step 0  
####   
#### The test program supplies prime numbers p and g.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### Alice picks a private key, a, greater than 1 and less than p.  
#### Bob does the same to pick a private key b.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Alice calculates a public key A.  
####   
####     A = gᵃ mod p  
####   
#### Using the same p and g, Bob similarly calculates a public key B from his private key b.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Alice and Bob exchange public keys.  
#### Alice calculates secret key s.  
####   
####     s = Bᵃ mod p  
####   
#### Bob calculates  
####   
####     s = Aᵇ mod p  
####   
#### The calculations produce the same result!  
#### Alice and Bob now share secret s.  
#### # Should I use random or secrets?  
####   
#### Python, as of version 3.6, includes two different random modules.  
####   
#### The module called `random` is pseudo-random, meaning it does not generate  
#### true randomness, but follows an algorithm that simulates randomness.  
#### Since random numbers are generated through a known algorithm, they are not truly random.  
####   
#### The `random` module is not correctly suited for cryptography and should not be used,  
#### precisely because it is pseudo-random.  
####   
#### For this reason, in version 3.6, Python introduced the `secrets` module, which generates  
#### cryptographically strong random numbers that provide the greater security required for cryptography.  
####   
#### Since this is only an exercise, `random` is fine to use, but note that **it would be  
#### very insecure if actually used for cryptography.**  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diffie_hellman.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the updated files with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange implementation:

diffie_hellman.py
```python
import random

def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p-1)


def public_key(p, g, private):
    return pow(g, private, p)


def secret(p, public, private):
    return pow(public, private, p)
```

I have implemented the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm as described in the instructions using the random module to generate private keys between 2 and p-1, and using pow() with the modulo p to calculate the public keys and shared secret. 

The functions take the prime numbers p and g as supplied by the test program, and generate and return the private key, public key, and shared secret key based on the private key. This allows Alice and Bob to independently generate matching public/private key pairs and calculate the same shared secret key to securely exchange encrypted messages.

Please let me know if any part of the implementation needs clarification or modification. I aimed to keep it simple and directly map to the algorithm description provided.
