#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.  
####   
#### While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.  
####   
#### This is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.  
####   
#### This is one of many common variants.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a spider.  
#### It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a bird.  
#### How absurd to swallow a bird!  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cat.  
#### Imagine that, to swallow a cat!  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a dog.  
#### What a hog, to swallow a dog!  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a goat.  
#### Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a cow.  
#### I don't know how she swallowed a cow!  
#### She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.  
#### She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.  
#### She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.  
#### She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.  
#### She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.  
#### She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.  
#### I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.  
####   
#### I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.  
#### She's dead, of course!  
#### ```

#### [cumulative-song]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: food_chain.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

food_chain.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    lyrics = ""
    animals = ["fly", "spider", "bird", "cat", "dog", "goat", "cow", "horse"]
    
    for i in range(start_verse, end_verse+1):
        lyrics += f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animals[i-1]}.\n"
        if i == 1:
            lyrics += "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.\n"
        else: 
            for j in range(i-1, 0, -1):
                lyrics += f"She swallowed the {animals[i-1]} to catch the {animals[j-1]}.\n"
            lyrics += "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.\n"
            
        if i < len(animals):
            lyrics += f"\n"
            
    return lyrics
```

This modifies the existing food_chain.py file to implement the recite function algorithmically based on the instructions. It stores the animals in a list, loops from the start to end verse, and builds up the lyrics string by appending the appropriate lines for each verse based on the animal index. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!

            lyrics += "\n"

```

The tests were failing because recite() was returning a string instead of a list containing the lyrics string, as expected by the tests. By returning lyrics inside a list, this should now pass all the tests.
