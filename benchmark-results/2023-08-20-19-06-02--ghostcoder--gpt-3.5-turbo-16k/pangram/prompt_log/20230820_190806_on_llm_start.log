Human: # Introduction

You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.
They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.
To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.

They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.
You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.

~~~~exercism/note
Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".

The best known English pangram is:

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

# Instructions

Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.

A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).

For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: pangram.py
```python
def is_pangram(sentence):
    pass

```
