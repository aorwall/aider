The current function `reverse` in `reverse_string.py` is not implemented. To reverse a string in Python, we can use slicing. Here is the updated code:

reverse_string.py
```
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]
```
This function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The `[::-1]` slice means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1, which is backward one step. This is a common Python idiom for string reversal.
