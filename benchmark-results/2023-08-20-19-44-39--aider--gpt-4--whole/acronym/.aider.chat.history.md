#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a phrase to its acronym.  
####   
#### Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!  
####   
#### Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).  
####   
#### Punctuation is handled as follows: hyphens are word separators (like whitespace); all other punctuation can be removed from the input.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### |Input|Output|  
#### |-|-|  
#### |As Soon As Possible|ASAP|  
#### |Liquid-crystal display|LCD|  
#### |Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: acronym.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the acronym generator, we need to split the input phrase into words, then take the first letter of each word, convert it to uppercase and join them together. We will use the `re` module from the Python standard library to handle the punctuation and splitting the phrase into words.

Here is the updated `acronym.py`:

acronym.py
```
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    words = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9- ]', '', words)  # remove all punctuation except hyphens
    words = re.split(r'[- ]', words)  # split words by spaces and hyphens
    acronym = ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in words if word)  # take the first letter of each word, convert to uppercase and join
    return acronym
```
This function will now return the acronym of the input phrase as per the provided instructions.
