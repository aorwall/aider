#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that makes an online multiplayer game called Lexiconia.  
####   
#### To play the game, each player is given 13 letters, which they must rearrange to create words.  
#### Different letters have different point values, since it's easier to create words with some letters than others.  
####   
#### The game was originally launched in English, but it is very popular, and now the company wants to expand to other languages as well.  
####   
#### Different languages need to support different point values for letters.  
#### The point values are determined by how often letters are used, compared to other letters in that language.  
####   
#### For example, the letter 'C' is quite common in English, and is only worth 3 points.  
#### But in Norwegian it's a very rare letter, and is worth 10 points.  
####   
#### To make it easier to add new languages, your team needs to change the way letters and their point values are stored in the game.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to change the data format of letters and their point values in the game.  
####   
#### Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping.  
####   
#### - 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",  
#### - 2 points: "D", "G",  
#### - 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",  
#### - 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",  
#### - 5 points: "K",  
#### - 8 points: "J", "X",  
#### - 10 points: "Q", "Z",  
####   
#### This needs to be changed to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.  
####   
#### - "a" is worth 1 point.  
#### - "b" is worth 3 points.  
#### - "c" is worth 3 points.  
#### - "d" is worth 2 points.  
#### - etc.  
####   
#### As part of this change, the team has also decided to change the letters to be lower-case rather than upper-case.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### If you want to look at how the data was previously structured and how it needs to change, take a look at the examples in the test suite.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: etl.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The task requires us to transform the data from a one-to-many mapping to a one-to-one mapping. In the provided `etl.py` file, we have a function `transform(legacy_data)` where `legacy_data` is the old format of data. We need to implement this function to return the new format of data.

Here is the updated `etl.py` file:

etl.py
```
def transform(legacy_data):
    return {letter.lower(): point for point, letters in legacy_data.items() for letter in letters}
```

In this function, we use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary where each key is a lower-case letter and each value is the corresponding point value. We iterate over the items in the `legacy_data` dictionary, where each item is a pair of a point value and a list of letters. For each letter in the list, we create a key-value pair in the new dictionary.
