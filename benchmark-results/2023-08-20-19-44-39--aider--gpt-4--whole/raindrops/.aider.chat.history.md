#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.  
#### A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.  
#### The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation][modulo].  
####   
#### The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:  
####   
#### - has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.  
#### - has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.  
#### - has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.  
#### - _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".  
#### - 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".  
#### - 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: raindrops.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to modify the `convert` function in the `raindrops.py` file. The function should take a number as an argument and return a string based on the factors of the number. If the number has 3 as a factor, we add 'Pling' to the result. If it has 5 as a factor, we add 'Plang' to the result. If it has 7 as a factor, we add 'Plong' to the result. If the number does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

Here is the updated `raindrops.py` file:

raindrops.py
```
def convert(number):
    result = ''
    if number % 3 == 0:
        result += 'Pling'
    if number % 5 == 0:
        result += 'Plang'
    if number % 7 == 0:
        result += 'Plong'
    if result == '':
        result = str(number)
    return result
```
This function works by checking if the number is divisible by 3, 5, and 7 using the modulo operation. If it is, it adds the corresponding string to the result. If the result is still an empty string after these checks, it means the number is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so it converts the number to a string and returns it.
