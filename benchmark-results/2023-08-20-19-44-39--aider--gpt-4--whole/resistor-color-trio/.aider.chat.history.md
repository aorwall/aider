#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### - Each band acts as a digit of a number.  
####   For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
####   The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.  
####   The color bands are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### In `resistor-color duo` you decoded the first two colors.  
#### For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.  
#### The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value.  
#### The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.  
#### For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.  
####   
#### (If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10.  
#### If Math is not your thing, go with the zeros.  
#### It really is the same thing, just in plain English instead of Math lingo.)  
####   
#### This exercise is about translating the colors into a label:  
####   
#### > "... ohms"  
####   
#### So an input of `"orange", "orange", "black"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 ohms"  
####   
#### When we get to larger resistors, a [metric prefix][metric-prefix] is used to indicate a larger magnitude of ohms, such as "kiloohms".  
#### That is similar to saying "2 kilometers" instead of "2000 meters", or "2 kilograms" for "2000 grams".  
####   
#### For example, an input of `"orange", "orange", "orange"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 kiloohms"  
####   
#### [metric-prefix]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_trio.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The instructions are clear. We need to implement the `label` function in the `resistor_color_trio.py` file. This function should take a list of three colors as input and return the resistance value in ohms or kiloohms as a string.

Here is the updated `resistor_color_trio.py` file:

resistor_color_trio.py
```
def label(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    value = (color_codes[colors[0]] * 10 + color_codes[colors[1]]) * (10 ** color_codes[colors[2]])

    if value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
```
This function first defines a dictionary `color_codes` that maps each color to its corresponding value. Then it calculates the resistance value by using the first two colors to form the main value and the third color to determine the number of zeros to add. If the value is 1000 or more, it returns the value in kiloohms; otherwise, it returns the value in ohms.

The current implementation of the `label` function in `resistor_color_trio.py` only handles the cases for ohms and kiloohms. However, the failed tests indicate that the function should also handle megaohms and gigaohms. 

We need to modify the `label` function to handle these cases. We can do this by adding additional conditions to check if the value is in the range of megaohms or gigaohms, and return the appropriate string.

Here is the updated `resistor_color_trio.py`:

```python
def label(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    value = (color_codes[colors[0]] * 10 + color_codes[colors[1]]) * (10 ** color_codes[colors[2]])

    if value >= 1000000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000000} gigaohms"
    elif value >= 1000000:
        return f"{value // 1000000} megaohms"
    elif value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
```

This updated function now checks if the value is in the range of gigaohms or megaohms, and returns the appropriate string. If the value is not in these ranges, it falls back to the previous implementation for kiloohms and ohms.
