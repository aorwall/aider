#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement basic list operations.  
####   
#### In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and `reduce` are very common.  
#### Implement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.  
####   
#### The precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general operations you will implement include:  
####   
#### - `append` (*given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list*);  
#### - `concatenate` (*given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list*);  
#### - `filter` (*given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True*);  
#### - `length` (*given a list, return the total number of items within it*);  
#### - `map` (*given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items*);  
#### - `foldl` (*given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left*);  
#### - `foldr` (*given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right*);  
#### - `reverse` (*given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order*).  
####   
#### Note, the ordering in which arguments are passed to the fold functions (`foldl`, `foldr`) is significant.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: list_ops.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on your instructions, here are the changes needed for the `list_ops.py` file:

1. Implement the `append` function to add all items in the second list to the end of the first list.
2. Implement the `concat` function to combine all items in all lists into one flattened list.
3. Implement the `filter` function to return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True.
4. Implement the `length` function to return the total number of items within a list.
5. Implement the `map` function to return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items.
6. Implement the `foldl` function to fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left.
7. Implement the `foldr` function to fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right.
8. Implement the `reverse` function to return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order.

Here is the updated `list_ops.py` file:

list_ops.py
```
def append(list1, list2):
    return list1 + list2


def concat(lists):
    return [item for sublist in lists for item in sublist]


def filter(function, list):
    return [item for item in list if function(item)]


def length(list):
    return sum(1 for _ in list)


def map(function, list):
    return [function(item) for item in list]


def foldl(function, list, initial):
    result = initial
    for item in list:
        result = function(result, item)
    return result


def foldr(function, list, initial):
    result = initial
    for item in reversed(list):
        result = function(result, item)
    return result


def reverse(list):
    return list[::-1]
```
This code uses list comprehension and built-in Python functions to implement the required list operations.
