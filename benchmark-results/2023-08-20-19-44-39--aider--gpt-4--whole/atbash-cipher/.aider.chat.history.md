#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.  
####   
#### The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.  
#### The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.  
####   
#### An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.  
#### However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.  
#### This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries.  
#### All text will be encoded as lowercase letters.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`  
#### - Encoding `x123 yes` gives `c123b vh`  
#### - Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`  
#### - Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: atbash_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Atbash cipher, we need to create a mapping of each letter in the alphabet to its corresponding letter in the reversed alphabet. We can use the built-in `ord` and `chr` functions in Python to convert between characters and their ASCII values, which will allow us to easily calculate the corresponding letter in the reversed alphabet.

In the `encode` function, we will iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, we will convert it to its corresponding letter in the reversed alphabet. If the character is a number, we will leave it unchanged. We will ignore all other characters. We will also group the output into groups of 5 characters for easier reading.

In the `decode` function, we will do the opposite: convert each character in the input string back to its original letter in the alphabet. We will ignore all characters that are not letters or numbers.

Here is the updated code:

atbash_cipher.py
```
def encode(plain_text):
    ciphered_text = ''
    for char in plain_text.lower():
        if char.isalpha():
            ciphered_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isdigit():
            ciphered_text += char
    return ' '.join(ciphered_text[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(ciphered_text), 5))

def decode(ciphered_text):
    plain_text = ''
    for char in ciphered_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            plain_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isdigit():
            plain_text += char
    return plain_text.replace(' ', '')
```
This code should work as expected according to the provided instructions. However, please note that it only works with the English alphabet and does not handle other characters or alphabets.
