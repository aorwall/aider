#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.  
####   
#### The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.  
####   
#### The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.  
####   
#### Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.  
####   
#### You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.  
#### Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: difference_of_squares.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the three functions in the `difference_of_squares.py` file. Here are the changes:

difference_of_squares.py
```
def square_of_sum(number):
    # The square of the sum of the first N natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: ((N*(N+1))/2)^2
    return ((number*(number+1))//2)**2


def sum_of_squares(number):
    # The sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: (N*(N+1)*(2N+1))/6
    return (number*(number+1)*(2*number+1))//6


def difference_of_squares(number):
    # The difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number)
```

The `square_of_sum` function calculates the square of the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula: ((N*(N+1))/2)^2.

The `sum_of_squares` function calculates the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers using the formula: (N*(N+1)*(2N+1))/6.

The `difference_of_squares` function calculates the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers by calling the `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares` functions and subtracting the results.
