#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement encoding and decoding for the rail fence cipher.  
####   
#### The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded.  
#### It was already used by the ancient Greeks.  
####   
#### In the Rail Fence cipher, the message is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom (like a zig-zag).  
#### Finally the message is then read off in rows.  
####   
#### For example, using three "rails" and the message "WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE", the cipherer writes out:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then reads off:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN  
#### ```  
####   
#### To decrypt a message you take the zig-zag shape and fill the ciphertext along the rows.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ?  
#### . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### The first row has seven spots that can be filled with "WECRLTE".  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Now the 2nd row takes "ERDSOEEFEAOC".  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Leaving "AIVDEN" for the last row.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### If you now read along the zig-zag shape you can read the original message.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rail_fence_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Rail Fence Cipher, we need to modify the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `rail_fence_cipher.py` file.

For the `encode` function, we will create a list of strings, each representing a rail. We will iterate over the message and add each character to the appropriate rail, moving up and down the rails as we go. Finally, we will join all the rails together to form the encoded message.

For the `decode` function, we will first calculate the length of each rail, then iterate over the encoded message and add each character to the appropriate rail. We will then iterate over the rails in a zig-zag pattern to form the decoded message.

Here is the updated `rail_fence_cipher.py` file:

rail_fence_cipher.py
```
def encode(message, rails):
    rails_list = [''] * rails
    rail, step = 0, 1

    for char in message:
        rails_list[rail] += char
        if rail == 0:
            step = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            step = -1
        rail += step

    return ''.join(rails_list)


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    rails_list = [''] * rails
    rail_lengths = [0] * rails
    rail, step = 0, 1

    for _ in encoded_message:
        rail_lengths[rail] += 1
        if rail == 0:
            step = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            step = -1
        rail += step

    i = 0
    for rail in range(rails):
        for _ in range(rail_lengths[rail]):
            rails_list[rail] += encoded_message[i]
            i += 1

    rail, step = 0, 1
    decoded_message = ''
    for _ in encoded_message:
        decoded_message += rails_list[rail][0]
        rails_list[rail] = rails_list[rail][1:]
        if rail == 0:
            step = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            step = -1
        rail += step

    return decoded_message
```
This code should correctly implement the Rail Fence Cipher for encoding and decoding messages.
