#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.  
####   
#### The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between `0` and `26`.  
#### Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic.  
#### The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.  
####   
#### The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.  
#### The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.  
####   
#### A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`  
#### - ROT0  `c` gives `c`  
#### - ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`  
#### - ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`  
#### - ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rotational_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Caesar cipher, we need to iterate over each character in the input text. If the character is a letter, we shift it by the key value, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary. If the character is not a letter (like a space or punctuation), we leave it as is.

Here is the updated code:

rotational_cipher.py
```
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + key) % 26 + ascii_offset)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

This function works by first checking if the current character is a letter with the `isalpha()` method. If it is, we calculate the ASCII value of the character, subtract the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' depending on the case to get a value between 0 and 25, add the key, and then take the modulus 26 to ensure the result is still within the range of the alphabet. We then convert this back to a character with the `chr()` function and add it to the result string. If the character is not a letter, we simply add it to the result string as is.
