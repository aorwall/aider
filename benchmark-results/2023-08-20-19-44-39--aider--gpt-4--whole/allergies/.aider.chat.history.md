#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.  
####   
#### An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).  
####   
#### The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:  
####   
#### - eggs (1)  
#### - peanuts (2)  
#### - shellfish (4)  
#### - strawberries (8)  
#### - tomatoes (16)  
#### - chocolate (32)  
#### - pollen (64)  
#### - cats (128)  
####   
#### So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.  
####   
#### Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:  
####   
#### - Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.  
#### - All the allergens Tom is allergic to.  
####   
#### Note: a given score may include allergens **not** listed above (i.e.  allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.).  
#### Your program should ignore those components of the score.  
#### For example, if the allergy score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: allergies.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `Allergies` class in the `allergies.py` file. The class should have the following methods:

- `__init__(self, score)`: This method should initialize the `Allergies` object with a score and calculate the list of allergies based on the score.
- `allergic_to(self, item)`: This method should return `True` if the person is allergic to the given item, and `False` otherwise.
- `lst(self)`: This method should return a list of all the allergies the person has.

Here is the updated `allergies.py` file:

allergies.py
```
class Allergies:

    ALLERGENS = {
        'eggs': 1,
        'peanuts': 2,
        'shellfish': 4,
        'strawberries': 8,
        'tomatoes': 16,
        'chocolate': 32,
        'pollen': 64,
        'cats': 128
    }

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score
        self.allergies = [allergen for allergen, value in self.ALLERGENS.items() if self.score & value]

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        return item in self.allergies

    @property
    def lst(self):
        return self.allergies
```

In the `__init__` method, we use a list comprehension to create a list of allergies. We use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if the binary representation of the score includes the binary representation of the value of each allergen. If it does, the person is allergic to that allergen, and we add it to the list.

The `allergic_to` method simply checks if the given item is in the list of allergies.

The `lst` method returns the list of allergies. We use the `@property` decorator to allow us to call this method as if it were a property, without parentheses.
