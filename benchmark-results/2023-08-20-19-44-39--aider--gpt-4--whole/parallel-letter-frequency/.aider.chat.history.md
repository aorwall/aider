#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.  
####   
#### Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.  
#### A common example is counting the frequency of letters.  
#### Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement this, we will use Python's built-in `concurrent.futures` module for parallel computation. We will use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a pool of threads, each of which can process a part of the text in parallel. 

The `calculate` function will be modified to take a list of texts as input. It will create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and submit a task for each text to the executor. Each task will involve counting the frequency of each letter in the text. The results of all tasks will be combined to get the total frequency of each letter.

Here is the updated code:

parallel_letter_frequency.py
```
import concurrent.futures
import collections

def calculate(texts):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(count_letters, text) for text in texts]
        counts = collections.Counter()
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            counts.update(future.result())
    return counts

def count_letters(text):
    return collections.Counter(c.lower() for c in text if c.isalpha())
```

In this code, `count_letters` is a helper function that counts the frequency of each letter in a single text. It uses a `collections.Counter` to do this. The `calculate` function uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run `count_letters` in parallel for each text. The results are combined using another `Counter`. The `as_completed` function is used to iterate over the futures as they complete, which allows the function to start combining results as soon as they are available.
