#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
#### <!-- prettier-ignore -->  
####     [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]

#### ## Customizing and Raising Exceptions  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.   
####   
#### Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).  
####   
#### For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you create two _custom exceptions_.  One exception to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your circular buffer is **full**, and one for when it is **empty**. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.  
####   
#### To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # subclassing the built-in BufferError to create BufferFullException  
#### class BufferFullException(BufferError):  
####     """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is full.  
####   
####     message: explanation of the error.  
####   
####     """  
####     def __init__(self, message):  
####         self.message = message  
####   
####           
#### # raising a BufferFullException  
#### raise BufferFullException("Circular buffer is full")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on your instructions, I will implement the `CircularBuffer` class with the following methods:

- `__init__(self, capacity)`: This method will initialize the buffer with a given capacity.
- `read(self)`: This method will read and remove the oldest element from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, it will raise a `BufferEmptyException`.
- `write(self, data)`: This method will add data to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it will raise a `BufferFullException`.
- `overwrite(self, data)`: This method will add data to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it will overwrite the oldest element in the buffer.
- `clear(self)`: This method will clear the buffer.

Here is the updated `circular_buffer.py` file:

circular_buffer.py
```
class BufferFullException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is full.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message="Circular buffer is full"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)


class BufferEmptyException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is empty.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message="Circular buffer is empty"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)


class CircularBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.buffer = [None]*capacity
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.start = 0
        self.end = 0

    def read(self):
        if self.buffer[self.start] is None:
            raise BufferEmptyException
        data = self.buffer[self.start]
        self.buffer[self.start] = None
        self.start = (self.start + 1) % self.capacity
        return data

    def write(self, data):
        if self.buffer[self.end] is not None:
            raise BufferFullException
        self.buffer[self.end] = data
        self.end = (self.end + 1) % self.capacity

    def overwrite(self, data):
        self.buffer[self.end] = data
        self.end = (self.end + 1) % self.capacity
        if self.buffer[self.start] is not None:
            self.start = (self.start + 1) % self.capacity

    def clear(self):
        self.buffer = [None]*self.capacity
        self.start = 0
        self.end = 0
```

The error message indicates that the `overwrite` method is not behaving as expected when the buffer is not full. It seems to be overwriting the next position even when the buffer is not full, which is not the expected behavior. 

The `overwrite` method should act like the `write` method when the buffer is not full. It should only overwrite the oldest element in the buffer when the buffer is full. 

Here is the corrected code:

circular_buffer.py
```
class BufferFullException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is full.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message="Circular buffer is full"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)


class BufferEmptyException(BufferError):
    """Exception raised when CircularBuffer is empty.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message="Circular buffer is empty"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)


class CircularBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.buffer = [None]*capacity
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.start = 0
        self.end = 0

    def read(self):
        if self.buffer[self.start] is None:
            raise BufferEmptyException
        data = self.buffer[self.start]
        self.buffer[self.start] = None
        self.start = (self.start + 1) % self.capacity
        return data

    def write(self, data):
        if self.buffer[self.end] is not None:
            raise BufferFullException
        self.buffer[self.end] = data
        self.end = (self.end + 1) % self.capacity

    def overwrite(self, data):
        if self.buffer[self.end] is None:
            self.write(data)
        else:
            self.buffer[self.end] = data
            self.end = (self.end + 1) % self.capacity
            if self.buffer[self.start] is not None:
                self.start = (self.start + 1) % self.capacity

    def clear(self):
        self.buffer = [None]*self.capacity
        self.start = 0
        self.end = 0
```
In the `overwrite` method, I added a condition to check if the current end position is None (which means the buffer is not full). If it is None, it calls the `write` method. If it's not None (which means the buffer is full), it overwrites the current end position and moves the end and start positions accordingly.
