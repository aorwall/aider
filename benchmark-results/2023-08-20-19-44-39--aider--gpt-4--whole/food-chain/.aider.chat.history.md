To generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly' algorithmically, we can create a list of the animals and their corresponding phrases. Then, we can iterate over this list to generate each verse of the song.

Here is the updated `food_chain.py` file:

food_chain.py
```
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    animals = [
        ("fly", ""),
        ("spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her."),
        ("bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!"),
        ("cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!"),
        ("dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!"),
        ("goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!"),
        ("cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!"),
        ("horse", "She's dead, of course!")
    ]

    verses = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        verses.append(f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animals[i][0]}.")
        if animals[i][1]:
            verses.append(animals[i][1])
        if i == len(animals) - 1:
            break
        for j in range(i, -1, -1):
            if j == 0:
                verses.append("I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.")
            else:
                verses.append(f"She swallowed the {animals[j][0]} to catch the {animals[j-1][0]}.")

    return verses
```

This function takes two parameters: `start_verse` and `end_verse`, which represent the starting and ending verses to be recited. It generates the lyrics for each verse within this range and returns them as a list of strings.

The error messages indicate that the code is not correctly generating the line "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her." Instead, it's generating "She swallowed the bird to catch the spider." 

The issue is that the code is not including the additional description of the spider when generating the lines about the old lady swallowing one animal to catch another. 

To fix this, we need to modify the code to include the additional description of the spider when generating these lines. 

Here is the corrected code:

food_chain.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    animals = [
        ("fly", ""),
        ("spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her."),
        ("bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!"),
        ("cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!"),
        ("dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!"),
        ("goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!"),
        ("cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!"),
        ("horse", "She's dead, of course!")
    ]

    verses = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        verses.append(f"I know an old lady who swallowed a {animals[i][0]}.")
        if animals[i][1]:
            verses.append(animals[i][1])
        if i == len(animals) - 1:
            break
        for j in range(i, -1, -1):
            if j == 0:
                verses.append("I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.")
            else:
                if animals[j][0] == "bird" and animals[j-1][0] == "spider":
                    verses.append(f"She swallowed the {animals[j][0]} to catch the {animals[j-1][0]} that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.")
                else:
                    verses.append(f"She swallowed the {animals[j][0]} to catch the {animals[j-1][0]}.")

    return verses
```
This code now checks if the current animal is a bird and the previous animal is a spider. If so, it includes the additional description of the spider in the generated line.
