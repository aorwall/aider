#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.  
####   
#### So given a string with embedded newlines like:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 9 8 7  
#### 5 3 2  
#### 6 6 7  
#### ```  
####   
#### representing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     1  2  3  
####   |---------  
#### 1 | 9  8  7  
#### 2 | 5  3  2  
#### 3 | 6  6  7  
#### ```  
####   
#### your code should be able to spit out:  
####   
#### - A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,  
#### - A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.  
####   
#### The rows for our example matrix:  
####   
#### - 9, 8, 7  
#### - 5, 3, 2  
#### - 6, 6, 7  
####   
#### And its columns:  
####   
#### - 9, 5, 6  
#### - 8, 3, 6  
#### - 7, 2, 7

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matrix.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.

Based on your instructions, we need to modify the `Matrix` class in the `matrix.py` file. We need to implement the `__init__`, `row`, and `column` methods. 

The `__init__` method should take a string representation of a matrix and convert it into a 2D list. Each row in the matrix string is separated by a newline character (`\n`), and each number in a row is separated by a space.

The `row` method should return the row at the given index. Python list indices start at 0, so we need to subtract 1 from the index to get the correct row.

The `column` method should return the column at the given index. This is a bit trickier than getting a row, because a column spans multiple lists in our 2D list. We can use a list comprehension to get all the elements at the given index from each row.

Here is the updated `matrix.py` file:

matrix.py
```
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        self.matrix = [[int(num) for num in row.split()] for row in matrix_string.split('\n')]

    def row(self, index):
        return self.matrix[index - 1]

    def column(self, index):
        return [row[index - 1] for row in self.matrix]
```
This code should work according to your instructions. However, please note that it doesn't handle invalid input, such as a matrix string that doesn't represent a valid matrix, or an index that's out of range. If you need to handle these cases, you'll need to add some error checking code.
