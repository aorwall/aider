#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed.  
#### All known life depends on DNA!  
####   
#### > Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.  
####   
#### DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.  
#### A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!  
#### We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".  
####   
#### We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.  
#### 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.  
####   
#### Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.  
#### If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2  
#### "INVALID" -> error  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nucleotide_count.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement two functions in the `nucleotide_count.py` file. 

The `count(strand, nucleotide)` function should return the count of a specific nucleotide in the given DNA strand. 

The `nucleotide_counts(strand)` function should return a dictionary with the counts of all four nucleotides in the given DNA strand. 

If the strand contains any characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', both functions should raise an error.

Here is the updated `nucleotide_count.py` file:

nucleotide_count.py
```
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if not all(x in 'ACGT' for x in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid strand")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    if not all(x in 'ACGT' for x in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid strand")
    return {'A': strand.count('A'), 'C': strand.count('C'), 'G': strand.count('G'), 'T': strand.count('T')}
```

In the `count` function, we first check if all characters in the strand are valid nucleotides. If not, we raise a `ValueError`. Then we return the count of the specified nucleotide in the strand.

In the `nucleotide_counts` function, we again check if all characters in the strand are valid nucleotides. If not, we raise a `ValueError`. Then we return a dictionary with the counts of all four nucleotides in the strand.

The error message indicates that a ValueError is not being raised when it should be. This is likely due to the fact that the `count` function does not check if the nucleotide being counted is valid. 

To fix this, we need to add a check in the `count` function to ensure that the nucleotide being counted is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If it is not, we should raise a ValueError.

Here is the updated code:

nucleotide_count.py
```
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if not all(x in 'ACGT' for x in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid strand")
    if nucleotide not in 'ACGT':
        raise ValueError("Invalid nucleotide")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    if not all(x in 'ACGT' for x in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid strand")
    return {'A': strand.count('A'), 'C': strand.count('C'), 'G': strand.count('G'), 'T': strand.count('T')}
```
