#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.  
#### If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.  
####   
#### [classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `School` class in the `grade_school.py` file. The class should have the following methods:

- `add_student(self, name, grade)`: This method should add a student to a specific grade. If the student is already added, it should indicate that this is incorrect.
- `roster(self)`: This method should return a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
- `grade(self, grade_number)`: This method should return a list of all students enrolled in a specific grade.

Here is the updated `grade_school.py` file:

grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade not in self.students:
            self.students[grade] = []
        if name in self.students[grade]:
            return "This student is already added."
        self.students[grade].append(name)
        self.students[grade].sort()

    def roster(self):
        roster = []
        for grade in sorted(self.students):
            roster.extend(self.students[grade])
        return roster

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.students:
            return self.students[grade_number]
        return []
```
This code creates a dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of students. The `add_student` method adds a student to a specific grade and sorts the students in that grade. The `roster` method returns a sorted list of all students in all grades. The `grade` method returns a list of all students in a specific grade.

The error messages indicate that the test cases are trying to call a method named `added()` on the `School` object, but this method does not exist in the current implementation of the `School` class. 

To fix this, we need to add an `added()` method to the `School` class. This method should return a dictionary where the keys are the grades and the values are lists of students in those grades. The students in each grade should be sorted in alphabetical order.

Here is the updated `grade_school.py` file:

grade_school.py
```
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade not in self.students:
            self.students[grade] = []
        if name in self.students[grade]:
            return "This student is already added."
        self.students[grade].append(name)
        self.students[grade].sort()

    def roster(self):
        roster = []
        for grade in sorted(self.students):
            roster.extend(self.students[grade])
        return roster

    def grade(self, grade_number):
        if grade_number in self.students:
            return self.students[grade_number]
        return []

    def added(self):
        return self.students
```
