#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create a custom set type.  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some type, like a set.  
#### In this exercise you will define your own set.  
#### How it works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of unique elements.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: custom_set.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the methods in the `CustomSet` class. Here's how we can do it:

custom_set.py
```python
class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=[]):
        self.set = set(elements)

    def isempty(self):
        return len(self.set) == 0

    def __contains__(self, element):
        return element in self.set

    def issubset(self, other):
        return self.set.issubset(other.set)

    def isdisjoint(self, other):
        return self.set.isdisjoint(other.set)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.set == other.set

    def add(self, element):
        self.set.add(element)

    def intersection(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set.intersection(other.set))

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set - other.set)

    def __add__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set.union(other.set))
```

In the `__init__` method, we initialize our `CustomSet` with a set of elements. The `isempty` method checks if the set is empty. The `__contains__` method checks if an element is in the set. The `issubset` method checks if the set is a subset of another set. The `isdisjoint` method checks if the set is disjoint with another set. The `__eq__` method checks if the set is equal to another set. The `add` method adds an element to the set. The `intersection` method returns the intersection of the set with another set. The `__sub__` method returns the difference of the set with another set. The `__add__` method returns the union of the set with another set.
