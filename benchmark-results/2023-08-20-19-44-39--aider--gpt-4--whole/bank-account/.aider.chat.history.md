#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
#### Watch out for concurrent transactions!  
####   
#### A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways.  
#### Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc.  
#### Shops can charge against the account.  
####   
#### Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language).  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:    
####   
####   
#### ```python  
#### # account is not open  
#### raise ValueError('account not open')  
####   
#### # account is already open  
#### raise ValueError('account already open')  
####   
#### # incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')  
####   
#### # withdrawal is too big  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on your instructions, I will implement the BankAccount class with thread-safe operations. The class will have the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the bank account. The account is closed by default and its balance is 0.
- `get_balance`: Returns the current balance of the account. Raises a ValueError if the account is closed.
- `open`: Opens the account. Raises a ValueError if the account is already open.
- `deposit`: Adds the specified amount to the account balance. Raises a ValueError if the account is closed or if the amount is not greater than 0.
- `withdraw`: Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance. Raises a ValueError if the account is closed, if the amount is not greater than 0, or if the amount is greater than the current balance.
- `close`: Closes the account. Raises a ValueError if the account is already closed.

Here is the updated code:

bank_account.py
```
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0
        self._is_open = False
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self._is_open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self._balance

    def open(self):
        with self._lock:
            if self._is_open:
                raise ValueError('account already open')
            self._is_open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        with self._lock:
            if not self._is_open:
                raise ValueError('account not open')
            if amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
            self._balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self._lock:
            if not self._is_open:
                raise ValueError('account not open')
            if amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
            if amount > self._balance:
                raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
            self._balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        with self._lock:
            if not self._is_open:
                raise ValueError('account not open')
            self._is_open = False
            self._balance = 0
```
This code uses a lock to ensure that the operations on the bank account are thread-safe. The lock is acquired before performing any operation that modifies the state of the bank account, and it is released after the operation is completed. This prevents multiple threads from modifying the state of the bank account at the same time, which could lead to inconsistent results.
