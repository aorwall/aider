#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.  
####   
#### There are some rules that your solution must follow:  
####   
#### - You can only do one action at a time.  
#### - There are only 3 possible actions:  
####   1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:  
####      a) the first bucket is empty  
####      b) the second bucket is full  
####   2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
####   3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
#### - After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.  
####   
#### Your program will take as input:  
####   
#### - the size of bucket one  
#### - the size of bucket two  
#### - the desired number of liters to reach  
#### - which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two  
####   
#### Your program should determine:  
####   
#### - the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket  
#### - which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two  
#### - how many liters are left in the other bucket  
####   
#### Note: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.  
####   
#### Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.  
#### Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).  
#### If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.  
#### Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.  
####   
#### Another Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.  
#### You are told you must start with bucket one.  
#### So your first action is to fill bucket one.  
#### You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.  
#### For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### raise ValueError("A meaningful error message here.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two_bucket.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `measure` function in the `two_bucket.py` file. This function should take the size of two buckets, the desired number of liters, and which bucket to fill first as input. It should return the total number of actions required to reach the desired number of liters, which bucket ends up with the desired number of liters, and how many liters are left in the other bucket.

Here is the updated `two_bucket.py` file:

two_bucket.py
```
def measure(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket):
    if start_bucket == 'one':
        bucket_one_current = bucket_one
        bucket_two_current = 0
    else:
        bucket_one_current = 0
        bucket_two_current = bucket_two

    actions = 1  # Initial fill

    while bucket_one_current != goal and bucket_two_current != goal:
        if bucket_one_current == 0:
            bucket_one_current = bucket_one
            actions += 1
        elif bucket_two_current == bucket_two:
            bucket_two_current = 0
            actions += 1
        else:
            transfer = min(bucket_one_current, bucket_two - bucket_two_current)
            bucket_one_current -= transfer
            bucket_two_current += transfer
            actions += 1

    if bucket_one_current == goal:
        return actions, 'one', bucket_two_current
    else:
        return actions, 'two', bucket_one_current
```
This function uses a while loop to continuously perform actions until the goal is reached. The actions are either filling a bucket, emptying a bucket, or transferring from one bucket to another. The number of actions is counted and returned along with which bucket contains the goal amount and how much is left in the other bucket.

#### Tests timed out!

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct.  
#### Fix the code in two_bucket.py to resolve the errors.

The provided code seems to be stuck in an infinite loop when the goal cannot be achieved with the given bucket sizes. This is likely the cause of the tests timing out. 

To fix this, we need to add a condition to break the loop when no progress is being made. This can be done by checking if the current state of the buckets is the same as in the previous iteration. If it is, we raise a ValueError as the goal cannot be achieved with the given bucket sizes.

Here is the updated code:

two_bucket.py
```
def measure(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket):
    if start_bucket == 'one':
        bucket_one_current = bucket_one
        bucket_two_current = 0
    else:
        bucket_one_current = 0
        bucket_two_current = bucket_two

    actions = 1  # Initial fill
    previous_state = (bucket_one_current, bucket_two_current)

    while bucket_one_current != goal and bucket_two_current != goal:
        if bucket_one_current == 0:
            bucket_one_current = bucket_one
            actions += 1
        elif bucket_two_current == bucket_two:
            bucket_two_current = 0
            actions += 1
        else:
            transfer = min(bucket_one_current, bucket_two - bucket_two_current)
            bucket_one_current -= transfer
            bucket_two_current += transfer
            actions += 1

        current_state = (bucket_one_current, bucket_two_current)
        if current_state == previous_state:
            raise ValueError("The goal cannot be achieved with the given bucket sizes.")
        previous_state = current_state

    if bucket_one_current == goal:
        return actions, 'one', bucket_two_current
    else:
        return actions, 'two', bucket_one_current
```
This code now raises a ValueError when the goal cannot be achieved, which should prevent the tests from timing out.
