#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999, spell out that number in English.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### Handle the basic case of 0 through 99.  
####   
#### If the input to the program is `22`, then the output should be `'twenty-two'`.  
####   
#### Your program should complain loudly if given a number outside the blessed range.  
####   
#### Some good test cases for this program are:  
####   
#### - 0  
#### - 14  
#### - 50  
#### - 98  
#### - -1  
#### - 100  
####   
#### ### Extension  
####   
#### If you're on a Mac, shell out to Mac OS X's `say` program to talk out loud.  
#### If you're on Linux or Windows, eSpeakNG may be available with the command `espeak`.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Implement breaking a number up into chunks of thousands.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield a list like 1, 234, 567, and 890, while the far simpler `1000` should yield just 1 and 0.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Now handle inserting the appropriate scale word between those chunks.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield `'1 billion 234 million 567 thousand 890'`  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
#### It's fine to stop at "trillion".  
####   
#### ## Step 4  
####   
#### Put it all together to get nothing but plain English.  
####   
#### `12345` should give `twelve thousand three hundred forty-five`.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the number input to `say()` is out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the number is negative  
#### raise ValueError("input out of range")  
####   
#### # if the number is larger than 999,999,999,999  
#### raise ValueError("input out of range")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: say.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the requested functionality, we need to make several changes to the `say.py` file. 

First, we need to implement the `say` function to handle numbers from 0 to 99. We will use a dictionary to map numbers to their English equivalents. 

Next, we will add error handling to raise a `ValueError` if the input number is out of range. 

Then, we will implement the logic to break a number up into chunks of thousands. 

Finally, we will handle inserting the appropriate scale word between those chunks and combine everything to return the number in plain English.

Here is the updated `say.py` file:

say.py
```
def say(number):
    if number < 0 or number > 999999999999:
        raise ValueError("input out of range")

    units = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]
    h_tens = ["twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]
    ones = ["", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
    teens = ["ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]

    if number == 0:
        return "zero"

    result = ""
    for unit in units:
        if number == 0:
            break

        number, n = divmod(number, 1000)
        if n == 0:
            continue

        hundreds, n = divmod(n, 100)
        tens, one = divmod(n, 10)

        words = []
        if hundreds > 0:
            words.append(ones[hundreds])
            words.append("hundred")
        if tens > 1:
            words.append(h_tens[tens - 2])
            if one > 0:
                words.append(ones[one])
        elif tens == 1:
            words.append(teens[one])
        else:
            words.append(ones[one])

        if words:
            result = " ".join(words) + " " + unit + " " + result

    return result.strip()
```
This function should now handle numbers from 0 to 999,999,999,999 and spell out that number in English. It will raise a `ValueError` if the input number is out of range.

The tests are failing because the current implementation of the `say` function does not include hyphens between tens and ones places for numbers between 21 and 99. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `say` function to include a hyphen between the tens and ones places for numbers between 21 and 99. 

Here is the updated `say.py` file:

say.py
```python
def say(number):
    if number < 0 or number > 999999999999:
        raise ValueError("input out of range")

    units = ["", "thousand", "million", "billion"]
    h_tens = ["twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]
    ones = ["", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
    teens = ["ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]

    if number == 0:
        return "zero"

    result = ""
    for unit in units:
        if number == 0:
            break

        number, n = divmod(number, 1000)
        if n == 0:
            continue

        hundreds, n = divmod(n, 100)
        tens, one = divmod(n, 10)

        words = []
        if hundreds > 0:
            words.append(ones[hundreds])
            words.append("hundred")
        if tens > 1:
            words.append(h_tens[tens - 2])
            if one > 0:
                words.append("-" + ones[one])
        elif tens == 1:
            words.append(teens[one])
        else:
            words.append(ones[one])

        if words:
            result = " ".join(words) + " " + unit + " " + result

    return result.strip()
```
In this updated version, a hyphen is added before the ones place if the tens place is greater than 1. This will ensure that numbers like 22 are pronounced as "twenty-two" instead of "twenty two".
