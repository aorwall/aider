#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.  
####   
#### Implement binary to decimal conversion.  
#### Given a binary input string, your program should produce a decimal output.  
#### The program should handle invalid inputs.  
####   
#### ## Note  
####   
#### - Implement the conversion yourself.  
####   Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.  
####   
#### ## About Binary (Base-2)  
####   
#### Decimal is a base-10 system.  
####   
#### A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:  
####   
#### - The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1  
#### - The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10  
#### - ...  
#### - The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.  
#### - All these values are summed.  
####   
#### So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`  
####   
#### Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.  
####   
#### So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal  
#### raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + digits)  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on your instructions, we need to implement the `parse_binary` function in the `binary.py` file. This function should take a binary string as input and return its decimal equivalent. If the input string is not a valid binary number, the function should raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful error message.

Here is the updated `binary.py` file:

binary.py
```
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    if not all(char in '01' for char in binary_string):
        raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + binary_string)
    
    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(binary_string)):
        decimal += int(digit) * 2 ** i
    return decimal
```

In this updated code, the `parse_binary` function first checks if all characters in the input string are either '0' or '1'. If not, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the input string is not a valid binary number.

Then, it initializes a variable `decimal` to 0. This variable will hold the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

Next, it iterates over the characters in the reversed input string. For each character, it converts it to an integer, multiplies it by 2 raised to the power of its position in the reversed string (which corresponds to its position from the right in the original string), and adds the result to `decimal`.

Finally, it returns `decimal`, which is the decimal equivalent of the input binary number.
