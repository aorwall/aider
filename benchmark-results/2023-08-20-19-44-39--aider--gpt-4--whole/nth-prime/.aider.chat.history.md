#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.  
####   
#### By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.  
####   
#### If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `prime()` function receives malformed input. Since this exercise deals only with _positive_ numbers, any number < 1 is malformed.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the prime function receives malformed input  
#### raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nth_prime.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `prime()` function, we need to create a helper function `is_prime()` to check if a number is prime. Then in the `prime()` function, we will keep generating numbers and checking if they are prime until we have found the nth prime number.

Here is the updated code:

nth_prime.py
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime(number):
    if number < 1:
        raise ValueError('there is no zeroth prime')
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < number:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num
```

In the `is_prime()` function, we check if a number is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is divisible, then it is not a prime number.

In the `prime()` function, we first check if the input number is less than 1. If it is, we raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message. Then we start generating numbers starting from 2 and check if they are prime. If a number is prime, we increment the count. We keep doing this until we have found the nth prime number.
