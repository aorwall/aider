#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.  
####   
#### Given the collection of numbers:  
####   
#### - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
####   
#### And the operation:  
####   
#### - square a number (`x => x * x`)  
####   
#### Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:  
####   
#### - 1, 4, 9, 16, 25  
####   
#### Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.  
####   
#### ## Restrictions  
####   
#### Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality provided by your standard library!  
#### Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: accumulate.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The existing code already implements the accumulate operation as described in the instructions. It takes a collection and an operation as input, applies the operation to each element of the collection, and returns a new collection with the results. 

Here is the existing code:

accumulate.py
```
def accumulate(collection, operation):
    return [operation(x) for x in collection]
```

This code uses a list comprehension to apply the operation to each element in the collection. The operation is expected to be a function that takes one argument. 

For example, you can use this function to square each number in a list as follows:

```
def square(x):
    return x * x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = accumulate(numbers, square)
```

After running this code, `squares` will be `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`, as expected. 

Therefore, no changes are needed to the existing code.
