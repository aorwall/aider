#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.  
####   
#### ## For example  
####   
#### - An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10]  
#### - An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]  
####   
#### ## Edge cases  
####   
#### - Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?  
#### - Can you ask for negative change?  
#### - Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in  
#### raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: change.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, we need to implement the `find_fewest_coins` function in the `change.py` file. This function should take a list of coins and a target amount, and return the fewest number of coins that add up to the target amount. If it's not possible to make the exact change, the function should raise a `ValueError`.

Here is the updated `change.py` file:

change.py
```
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Target cannot be negative")
    if target != 0 and min(coins) > target:
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")
    
    dp = [float('inf')] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)

    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    result = []
    while target:
        for coin in coins:
            if target >= coin and dp[target] == dp[target - coin] + 1:
                result.append(coin)
                target -= coin
                break

    return result
```

This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first checks if the target is negative or if it's smaller than the smallest coin, in which case it raises a `ValueError`. It then creates a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is the fewest number of coins that add up to `i`. It iterates over each coin, and for each coin it updates `dp[x]` for all `x` from `coin` to `target`. If `dp[target]` is still `inf` after this, it means that it's not possible to make the exact change, so it raises a `ValueError`. Finally, it constructs the result list by repeatedly choosing the coin that reduces the target to `dp[target - coin]`, and returns this list.

The test failures are due to the error messages not matching exactly with what's expected in the tests. The error messages in the code start with a capital letter, while the tests expect them to start with a lowercase letter. 

Here is the corrected code:

change.py
```
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("target can't be negative")
    if target != 0 and min(coins) > target:
        raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")
    
    dp = [float('inf')] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)

    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")

    result = []
    while target:
        for coin in coins:
            if target >= coin and dp[target] == dp[target - coin] + 1:
                result.append(coin)
                target -= coin
                break

    return result
```
