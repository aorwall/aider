#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a year, report if it is a leap year.  
####   
#### The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### on every year that is evenly divisible by 4  
####   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100  
####     unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400  
#### ```  
####   
#### For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  
#### 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!  
####   
#### For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Based on the instructions, the `leap_year` function needs to be implemented to check if a given year is a leap year or not. The function should return `True` if the year is a leap year and `False` otherwise. 

Here is the updated code:

leap.py
```
def leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function works by first checking if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, it then checks if the year is also divisible by 100. If it is, it then checks if the year is divisible by 400. If it is, then the year is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 4, then it is not a leap year.
