#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `sublist` function in the `sublist.py` file. 

We will also need to assign unique integer values to the constants `SUBLIST`, `SUPERLIST`, `EQUAL`, and `UNEQUAL` so that they can be used to represent the different possible relationships between the two lists.

Here is the updated `sublist.py` file:

sublist.py
```
"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

"""

# Possible sublist categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
SUBLIST = 1
SUPERLIST = 2
EQUAL = 3
UNEQUAL = 4


def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif is_sublist(list_one, list_two):
        return SUBLIST
    elif is_sublist(list_two, list_one):
        return SUPERLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL


def is_sublist(smaller, larger):
    len_smaller = len(smaller)
    len_larger = len(larger)
    return any(smaller == larger[i:i+len_smaller] for i in range(len_larger - len_smaller + 1))
```

In the `sublist` function, we first check if the two lists are equal. If they are, we return `EQUAL`. If not, we check if `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two` by calling the `is_sublist` helper function. If it is, we return `SUBLIST`. If not, we check if `list_one` is a superlist of `list_two` by checking if `list_two` is a sublist of `list_one`. If it is, we return `SUPERLIST`. If none of these conditions are met, we return `UNEQUAL`.

The `is_sublist` helper function checks if the first list is a sublist of the second list by iterating over the second list and checking if any slice of it is equal to the first list.
