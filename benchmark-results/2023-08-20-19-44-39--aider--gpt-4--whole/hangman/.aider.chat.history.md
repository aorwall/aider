#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.  
####   
#### [Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.  
####   
#### [Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.  
#### It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write "the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed."  
####   
#### Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.  
#### You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.  
####

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Python Special Instructions  
####   
#### A third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.  
####   
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when player tries to play, but the game is already over.  
#### raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hangman.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the hangman game, we need to add logic to the existing methods in the Hangman class. Here's what we need to do:

1. In the `__init__` method, we need to store the word and also create a masked version of the word.
2. In the `guess` method, we need to check if the guessed character is in the word. If it is, we reveal it in the masked word. If it's not, we decrement the remaining guesses. We also need to update the game status here.
3. In the `get_masked_word` method, we simply return the masked word.
4. In the `get_status` method, we return the current game status.

Here's the updated code:

hangman.py
```
# Game status categories
# Change the values as you see fit
STATUS_WIN = 'win'
STATUS_LOSE = 'lose'
STATUS_ONGOING = 'ongoing'


class Hangman:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.remaining_guesses = 9
        self.status = STATUS_ONGOING
        self.word = word
        self.masked_word = ['_' for _ in word]

    def guess(self, char):
        if self.status != STATUS_ONGOING:
            raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
        
        if char in self.word:
            for i, c in enumerate(self.word):
                if c == char:
                    self.masked_word[i] = char
        else:
            self.remaining_guesses -= 1

        if self.remaining_guesses < 0:
            self.status = STATUS_LOSE
        elif '_' not in self.masked_word:
            self.status = STATUS_WIN

    def get_masked_word(self):
        return ''.join(self.masked_word)

    def get_status(self):
        return self.status
```
This code should work as expected for a basic hangman game. However, it doesn't handle cases where the same character is guessed multiple times, and it doesn't handle case sensitivity. You might want to add additional logic to handle these cases.

The error message indicates that the game does not count a correct guess repeated as a failure. This means that if a player guesses the same correct letter twice, the game should decrease the remaining guesses count. 

To fix this, we need to keep track of the guessed letters and check if a letter has been guessed before. If it has, we decrease the remaining guesses count.

Here is the updated `hangman.py`:

```python
# Game status categories
# Change the values as you see fit
STATUS_WIN = 'win'
STATUS_LOSE = 'lose'
STATUS_ONGOING = 'ongoing'


class Hangman:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.remaining_guesses = 9
        self.status = STATUS_ONGOING
        self.word = word
        self.masked_word = ['_' for _ in word]
        self.guessed_letters = set()

    def guess(self, char):
        if self.status != STATUS_ONGOING:
            raise ValueError("The game has already ended.")
        
        if char in self.guessed_letters:
            self.remaining_guesses -= 1
        elif char in self.word:
            for i, c in enumerate(self.word):
                if c == char:
                    self.masked_word[i] = char
            self.guessed_letters.add(char)
        else:
            self.remaining_guesses -= 1

        if self.remaining_guesses < 0:
            self.status = STATUS_LOSE
        elif '_' not in self.masked_word:
            self.status = STATUS_WIN

    def get_masked_word(self):
        return ''.join(self.masked_word)

    def get_status(self):
        return self.status
```

This code adds a `guessed_letters` set to the `Hangman` class to keep track of the letters that have been guessed. In the `guess` method, it first checks if the guessed letter is in the `guessed_letters` set. If it is, it decreases the remaining guesses count. If it's not and it's in the word, it reveals the letter in the masked word and adds the letter to the `guessed_letters` set. If the letter is not in the word, it simply decreases the remaining guesses count.
