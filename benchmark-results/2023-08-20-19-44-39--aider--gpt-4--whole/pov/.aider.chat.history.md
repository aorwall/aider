#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Reparent a tree on a selected node.  
####   
#### A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.  
#### That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.  
####   
#### This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.  
#### For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     +------0------+  
####     |      |      |  
####   +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+  
####   |   |  |   |  |   |  
####   4   5  6   7  8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### But there is no inherent direction in a tree.  
#### The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.  
#### So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:  
####   
#### ```text  
####         6  
####         |  
####   +-----2-----+  
####   |           |  
####   7     +-----0-----+  
####         |           |  
####       +-1-+       +-3-+  
####       |   |       |   |  
####       4   5       8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.  
#### So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.  
####   
#### This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV  
#### raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")  
####   
#### #when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.  
#### raise ValueError("No path found")  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The instructions provided indicate that we need to implement the `from_pov` and `path_to` methods in the `Tree` class. 

The `from_pov` method should reorient the tree from the perspective of the given node. If the node does not exist in the tree, it should raise a `ValueError` with the message "Tree could not be reoriented".

The `path_to` method should return the path from the `from_node` to the `to_node`. If no path exists, it should raise a `ValueError` with the message "No path found".

Here is the updated `pov.py` file:

pov.py
```
from json import dumps


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, children=None):
        self.label = label
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __dict__(self):
        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}

    def __str__(self, indent=None):
        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.label < other.label

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()

    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        path = self.path_to(self.label, from_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")
        for node in reversed(path):
            self.reparent(node)
        return self

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        if from_node == to_node:
            return [from_node]
        for child in self.children:
            if child.label == from_node:
                path = child.path_to(from_node, to_node)
                if path:
                    return [self.label] + path
        return None

    def reparent(self, new_root):
        if self.label == new_root:
            return
        for child in self.children:
            if child.label == new_root:
                self.children.remove(child)
                child.children.append(self)
                self.label, child.label = child.label, self.label
                self.children, child.children = child.children, self.children
                return
            child.reparent(new_root)
```
This code implements the `from_pov` and `path_to` methods as per the instructions. The `from_pov` method finds the path to the new root and reparents each node along the path. The `path_to` method recursively searches for a path from the current node to the target node. The `reparent` method changes the parent of a node to a new node.

The error messages indicate that the `from_pov` method is raising a `ValueError` with the message "Tree could not be reoriented". This happens when the `path_to` method returns `None`, which means that no path was found from the current node to the `from_node`. 

The issue seems to be in the `path_to` method. It only checks the direct children of the current node, but it should also check the children of the children, and so on. This can be achieved by modifying the `path_to` method to use a depth-first search algorithm.

Here is the updated `pov.py` file:

pov.py
```
from json import dumps


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, children=None):
        self.label = label
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __dict__(self):
        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}

    def __str__(self, indent=None):
        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.label < other.label

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()

    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        path = self.path_to(self.label, from_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")
        for node in reversed(path):
            self.reparent(node)
        return self

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        if from_node == to_node:
            return [from_node]
        for child in self.children:
            path = child.path_to(from_node, to_node)
            if path:
                return [self.label] + path
        for child in self.children:
            for grandchild in child.children:
                path = grandchild.path_to(from_node, to_node)
                if path:
                    return [self.label, child.label] + path
        return None

    def reparent(self, new_root):
        if self.label == new_root:
            return
        for child in self.children:
            if child.label == new_root:
                self.children.remove(child)
                child.children.append(self)
                self.label, child.label = child.label, self.label
                self.children, child.children = child.children, self.children
                return
            child.reparent(new_root)
```
