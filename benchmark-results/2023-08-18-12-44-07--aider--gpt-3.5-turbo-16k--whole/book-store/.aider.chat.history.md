#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) * $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) * $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book_store.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `book_store.py` is just a function stub for the `total` function. We need to implement the logic to calculate the price of a shopping basket based on the given discounts.

Here's the updated code for `book_store.py`:

book_store.py
```
def total(basket):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each book
    book_counts = {}
    for book in basket:
        if book in book_counts:
            book_counts[book] += 1
        else:
            book_counts[book] = 1
    
    # Calculate the total price
    total_price = 0
    while book_counts:
        # Calculate the maximum discount for the current set of books
        max_discount = 0
        for count in book_counts.values():
            if count > 0:
                max_discount += 1
        discount = max_discount * 5
        
        # Calculate the price for the current set of books
        price = (8 * len(book_counts)) * (1 - discount / 100)
        total_price += price
        
        # Reduce the count of books in the current set
        for book in book_counts:
            book_counts[book] -= 1
            if book_counts[book] == 0:
                del book_counts[book]
    
    return total_price
```

This updated code calculates the price of a shopping basket by iterating over the books in the basket and counting the number of occurrences of each book. Then, it calculates the maximum discount based on the number of different books in the current set. Finally, it calculates the price for the current set of books and adds it to the total price. The process is repeated until all books have been accounted for.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Here is the updated content of the `book_store.py` file:

book_store.py
```
def total(basket):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each book
    book_counts = {}
    for book in basket:
        if book in book_counts:
            book_counts[book] += 1
        else:
            book_counts[book] = 1
    
    # Calculate the total price
    total_price = 0
    while book_counts:
        # Calculate the maximum discount for the current set of books
        max_discount = 0
        for count in book_counts.values():
            if count > 0:
                max_discount += 1
        discount = max_discount * 5
        
        # Calculate the price for the current set of books
        price = (8 * len(book_counts)) * (1 - discount / 100)
        total_price += price
        
        # Reduce the count of books in the current set
        books_to_remove = []
        for book in book_counts:
            book_counts[book] -= 1
            if book_counts[book] == 0:
                books_to_remove.append(book)
        
        for book in books_to_remove:
            del book_counts[book]
    
    return total_price
```

The issue in the original code was that the dictionary `book_counts` was being modified during iteration, which caused a `RuntimeError`. To fix this, I added a separate list `books_to_remove` to store the books that need to be removed from the dictionary after the iteration is complete. Then, I removed those books from the dictionary using another loop. This ensures that the dictionary is not modified during iteration and resolves the `RuntimeError` issue.
