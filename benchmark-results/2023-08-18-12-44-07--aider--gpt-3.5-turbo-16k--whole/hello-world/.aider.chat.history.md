The current content of the `hello_world.py` file is already correct. It defines a function `hello()` that returns the string "Goodbye, Mars!". However, the instructions ask for the function to return the string "Hello, World!". 

To fix this, we need to update the return statement of the `hello()` function to return "Hello, World!" instead of "Goodbye, Mars!".

Here is the updated content of the `hello_world.py` file:

hello_world.py
```
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

> Applied edit to hello_world.py
