#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a government agency that has intercepted a series of encrypted communication signals from a group of bank robbers.  
#### The signals contain a long sequence of digits.  
#### Your team needs to use various digital signal processing techniques to analyze the signals and identify any patterns that may indicate the planning of a heist.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to look for patterns in the long sequence of digits in the encrypted signal.  
####   
#### The technique you're going to use here is called the largest series product.  
####   
#### Let's define a few terms, first.  
####   
#### - **input**: the sequence of digits that you need to analyze  
#### - **series**: a sequence of adjacent digits (those that are next to each other) that is contained within the input  
#### - **span**: how many digits long each series is  
#### - **product**: what you get when you multiply numbers together  
####   
#### Let's work through an example, with the input `"63915"`.  
####   
#### - To form a series, take adjacent digits in the original input.  
#### - If you are working with a span of `3`, there will be three possible series:  
####   - `"639"`  
####   - `"391"`  
####   - `"915"`  
#### - Then we need to calculate the product of each series:  
####   - The product of the series `"639"` is 162 (`6 × 3 × 9 = 162`)  
####   - The product of the series `"391"` is 27 (`3 × 9 × 1 = 27`)  
####   - The product of the series `"915"` is 45 (`9 × 1 × 5 = 45`)  
#### - 162 is bigger than both 27 and 45, so the largest series product of `"63915"` is from the series `"639"`.  
####   So the answer is **162**.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when your `largest_product()` function receives invalid input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  Feel free to reuse your code from the `series` exercise!  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # span of numbers is longer than number series  
#### raise ValueError("span must be smaller than string length")  
####   
#### # span of number is negative  
#### raise ValueError("span must not be negative")  
####   
#### # series includes non-number input  
#### raise ValueError("digits input must only contain digits")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: largest_series_product.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. We need to implement the `largest_product` function according to the given instructions. Here's the updated code for `largest_series_product.py`:

largest_series_product.py
```
def largest_product(series, size):
    if size < 0:
        raise ValueError("span must not be negative")
    if size > len(series):
        raise ValueError("span must be smaller than string length")
    if not series.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("digits input must only contain digits")

    max_product = 0
    for i in range(len(series) - size + 1):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, i + size):
            product *= int(series[j])
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product

    return max_product
```

I have added input validation checks to ensure that the `size` parameter is not negative, is smaller than the length of the `series`, and that the `series` only contains digits. Then, I have implemented the logic to calculate the largest product by iterating over all possible series of the given size and calculating their product. Finally, I return the maximum product found.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
