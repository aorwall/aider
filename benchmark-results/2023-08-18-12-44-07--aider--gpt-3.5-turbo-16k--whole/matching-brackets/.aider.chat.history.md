#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched and nested correctly.  
#### The string may also contain other characters, which for the purposes of this exercise should be ignored.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: matching_brackets.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The existing code in `matching_brackets.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to make changes to the code.

Here's the updated code for `matching_brackets.py`:

matching_brackets.py
```
def is_paired(input_string):
    stack = []
    opening_brackets = ['[', '{', '(']
    closing_brackets = [']', '}', ')']
    bracket_pairs = {'[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}

    for char in input_string:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in closing_brackets:
            if not stack:
                return False
            last_opening_bracket = stack.pop()
            if bracket_pairs[last_opening_bracket] != char:
                return False

    return len(stack) == 0
```

In the updated code, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. Whenever we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the last opening bracket on the stack. If it doesn't match or if the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket, we return `False`. Finally, we check if the stack is empty at the end to ensure that all brackets are properly matched and nested.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
