#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that makes an online, fantasy-survival game.  
####   
#### When a player finishes a level, they are awarded energy points.  
#### The amount of energy awarded depends on which magical items the player found while exploring that level.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to write the code that calculates the energy points that get awarded to players when they complete a level.  
####   
#### The points awarded depend on two things:  
####   
#### - The level (a number) that the player completed.  
#### - The base value of each magical item collected by the player during that level.  
####   
#### The energy points are awarded according to the following rules:  
####   
#### 1. For each magical item, take the base value and find all the multiples of that value that are less than the level number.  
#### 2. Combine the sets of numbers.  
#### 3. Remove any duplicates.  
#### 4. Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.  
####   
#### Let's look at an example:  
####   
#### **The player completed level 20 and found two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.**  
####   
#### To calculate the energy points earned by the player, we need to find all the unique multiples of these base values that are less than level 20.  
####   
#### - Multiples of 3 less than 20: `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}`  
#### - Multiples of 5 less than 20: `{5, 10, 15}`  
#### - Combine the sets and remove duplicates: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18}`  
#### - Sum the unique multiples: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`  
#### - Therefore, the player earns **78** energy points for completing level 20 and finding the two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### You can make the following assumptions about the inputs to the  
#### `sum_of_multiples` function:  
#### * All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers  
#### including zero.  
#### * A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique  
#### and sorted in ascending order.  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sum_of_multiples.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `sum_of_multiples.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. We need to modify the code to implement the logic described in the instructions.

Here's the updated code for `sum_of_multiples.py`:

sum_of_multiples.py
```
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    unique_multiples = set()
    for base_value in multiples:
        for i in range(base_value, limit, base_value):
            unique_multiples.add(i)
    return sum(unique_multiples)
```

In the updated code, we iterate over each base value in the `multiples` list. For each base value, we iterate from the base value up to the `limit` (exclusive) with a step of the base value. This allows us to find all the multiples of the base value that are less than the `limit`. We add these multiples to a set to remove duplicates. Finally, we return the sum of all the unique multiples.

Please replace the content of `sum_of_multiples.py` with the updated code.

The errors are occurring because the code is trying to use a base value of 0 in the range function, which is not allowed. To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the base value is zero before using it in the range function.

Here is the updated code for `sum_of_multiples.py`:

sum_of_multiples.py
```
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    unique_multiples = set()
    for base_value in multiples:
        if base_value != 0:
            for i in range(base_value, limit, base_value):
                unique_multiples.add(i)
    return sum(unique_multiples)
```

Now the code will skip the iteration if the base value is zero, preventing the error from occurring.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
