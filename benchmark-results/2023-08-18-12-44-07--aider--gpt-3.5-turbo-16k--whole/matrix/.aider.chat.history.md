#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.  
####   
#### So given a string with embedded newlines like:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 9 8 7  
#### 5 3 2  
#### 6 6 7  
#### ```  
####   
#### representing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     1  2  3  
####   |---------  
#### 1 | 9  8  7  
#### 2 | 5  3  2  
#### 3 | 6  6  7  
#### ```  
####   
#### your code should be able to spit out:  
####   
#### - A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,  
#### - A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.  
####   
#### The rows for our example matrix:  
####   
#### - 9, 8, 7  
#### - 5, 3, 2  
#### - 6, 6, 7  
####   
#### And its columns:  
####   
#### - 9, 5, 6  
#### - 8, 3, 6  
#### - 7, 2, 7

#### In this exercise you're going to create a **class**.  _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think!_

The current code in `matrix.py` is just a class stub with empty methods. To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to make the following changes:

1. In the `__init__` method, we need to parse the input `matrix_string` and store it as an instance variable.
2. In the `row` method, we need to return the row at the given index.
3. In the `column` method, we need to return the column at the given index.

Here is the updated code for `matrix.py`:

matrix.py
```
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        self.matrix = []
        rows = matrix_string.split('\n')
        for row in rows:
            self.matrix.append([int(num) for num in row.split()])

    def row(self, index):
        return self.matrix[index - 1]

    def column(self, index):
        return [row[index - 1] for row in self.matrix]
```

No additional files are needed for this implementation.
