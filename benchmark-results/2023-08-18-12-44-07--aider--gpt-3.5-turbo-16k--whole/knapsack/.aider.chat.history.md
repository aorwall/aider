#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).  
#### Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.  
#### However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).  
####   
#### Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.  
#### Note that Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Limit: 10  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
####   
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `knapsack.py` is just a function stub. We need to implement the `maximum_value` function to solve the knapsack problem.

Here's the updated code for `knapsack.py`:

knapsack.py
```
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    n = len(items)
    dp = [[0] * (maximum_weight + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, maximum_weight + 1):
            if items[i - 1]["weight"] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - items[i - 1]["weight"]] + items[i - 1]["value"])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    return dp[n][maximum_weight]
```

The updated code uses dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem. It creates a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight and item combination. The outer loop iterates over the items, and the inner loop iterates over the weights. For each item and weight, it checks if the item can be included in the knapsack without exceeding the weight limit. If it can, it calculates the maximum value by either including or excluding the item. Finally, it returns the maximum value that can be obtained for the given weight limit.
