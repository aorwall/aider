#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.  
####   
#### The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between `0` and `26`.  
#### Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic.  
#### The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.  
####   
#### The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.  
#### The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.  
####   
#### A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`  
#### - ROT0  `c` gives `c`  
#### - ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`  
#### - ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`  
#### - ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rotational_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current implementation of the `rotate` function in `rotational_cipher.py` is empty. We need to implement the logic to perform the rotational cipher.

Here's an updated version of the `rotate` function that implements the rotational cipher:

rotational_cipher.py
```
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                ascii_offset = ord('A')
            else:
                ascii_offset = ord('a')
            shifted_char = chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + key) % 26 + ascii_offset)
            result += shifted_char
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

In this updated implementation, we iterate over each character in the input `text`. If the character is alphabetic, we determine the ASCII offset based on whether it is uppercase or lowercase. We then calculate the shifted character by subtracting the ASCII offset, adding the key, and taking the modulus 26 to handle wrapping around the alphabet. Finally, we convert the shifted character back to a character using `chr` and append it to the `result` string. If the character is not alphabetic, we simply append it to the `result` string as is.

This implementation should correctly perform the rotational cipher based on the given key.
