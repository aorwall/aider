#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.  
####   
#### A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  
####   
#### Note that 1 is not a prime number.  
####   
#### ## Example  
####   
#### What are the prime factors of 60?  
####   
#### - Our first divisor is 2.  
####   2 goes into 60, leaving 30.  
#### - 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.  
####   - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15.  
####     So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.  
#### - 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.  
####   - 3 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 4.  
####   - 4 does not go cleanly into 5.  
####     The next possible factor is 5.  
#### - 5 does go cleanly into 5.  
#### - We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.  
####   
#### Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.  
####   
#### You can check this yourself:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### 2 * 2 * 3 * 5  
#### = 4 * 15  
#### = 60  
#### ```  
####   
#### Success!

The current code in `prime_factors.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To compute the prime factors of a given natural number, we need to implement the `factors` function.

Here's the updated code for `prime_factors.py`:

prime_factors.py
```
def factors(value):
    factors_list = []
    divisor = 2

    while value > 1:
        if value % divisor == 0:
            factors_list.append(divisor)
            value = value / divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1

    return factors_list
```

In this updated code:
- We initialize an empty list `factors_list` to store the prime factors.
- We start with a divisor of 2 and iterate until the value becomes 1.
- If the value is divisible by the current divisor, we append the divisor to the `factors_list` and divide the value by the divisor.
- If the value is not divisible by the current divisor, we increment the divisor by 1 and continue the iteration.
- Finally, we return the `factors_list` containing the prime factors of the given value.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
