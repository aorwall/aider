#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Translate RNA sequences into proteins.  
####   
#### RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCU"` => translates to  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU"`  
#### => which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  
#### If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.  
#### However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.  
####   
#### There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.  
####   
#### All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG"` =>  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAA", "AUG"` =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### Note the stop codon `"UAA"` terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.  
####   
#### Below are the codons and resulting Amino Acids needed for the exercise.  
####   
#### Codon                 | Protein  
#### :---                  | :---  
#### AUG                   | Methionine  
#### UUU, UUC              | Phenylalanine  
#### UUA, UUG              | Leucine  
#### UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG    | Serine  
#### UAU, UAC              | Tyrosine  
#### UGU, UGC              | Cysteine  
#### UGG                   | Tryptophan  
#### UAA, UAG, UGA         | STOP

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. To implement the protein translation functionality, we need to add code that will take an RNA sequence as input, break it into codons, and translate each codon into its corresponding protein. We also need to handle the termination of translation when a stop codon is encountered.

Here's the updated code for the `proteins` function in `protein_translation.py`:

protein_translation.py
```
def proteins(strand):
    codon_protein_map = {
        "AUG": "Methionine",
        "UUU": "Phenylalanine",
        "UUC": "Phenylalanine",
        "UUA": "Leucine",
        "UUG": "Leucine",
        "UCU": "Serine",
        "UCC": "Serine",
        "UCA": "Serine",
        "UCG": "Serine",
        "UAU": "Tyrosine",
        "UAC": "Tyrosine",
        "UGU": "Cysteine",
        "UGC": "Cysteine",
        "UGG": "Tryptophan",
        "UAA": "STOP",
        "UAG": "STOP",
        "UGA": "STOP"
    }

    codons = [strand[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(strand), 3)]
    proteins = []
    for codon in codons:
        protein = codon_protein_map.get(codon)
        if protein == "STOP":
            break
        if protein:
            proteins.append(protein)
    return proteins
```

This code defines a dictionary `codon_protein_map` that maps each codon to its corresponding protein. It then breaks the input `strand` into codons using a list comprehension. For each codon, it looks up the corresponding protein in the `codon_protein_map` and appends it to the `proteins` list. If a stop codon is encountered, the loop breaks and the translation is terminated. Finally, the `proteins` list is returned.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
