#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `connect.py` is just a class stub with empty methods. To implement the game logic and compute the winner, we need to make the following changes:

1. Add a `board` attribute to the `ConnectGame` class to store the game board.
2. Implement the `get_winner` method to compute the winner based on the game board.

Here is the updated code for `connect.py`:

connect.py
```
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board

    def get_winner(self):
        # Check if any player has connected their stones from one side to the opposite side
        # Implement the game logic here and return the winner ('O', 'X') or None if there is no winner
        pass
```

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
