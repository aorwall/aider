#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is  
#### responsible for.  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in actual dirt, and grow actual plants.  
####   
#### They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
####   
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and  
#### planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available  
#### types of seeds.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,  
#### - Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,  
#### - Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row.  
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names.  
####   
#### The following diagram represents Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover

#### ## Python Implementation  
####   
#### The tests for this exercise expect your program to be implemented as a Garden `class` in Python.  
#### If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.  
####   
#### Your `class` should implement a `method` called plants, which takes a student's name as an argument and returns the `list` of plant names belonging to that student.  
####   
#### ## Constructors  
####   
#### Creating the example garden  
####   
#### ```  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### would, in the tests, be represented as `Garden("VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV")`.  
####   
#### To make this representation work, your `class` will need to implement an `__init__()` method.  
#### If you're not familiar with `__init__()` or _constructors_, [class and instance objects][class vs instance objects in python] from the Python docs gives a more detailed explanation.  
####   
####   
#### ## Default Parameters  
####   
#### In some tests, a `list` of students is passed as an argument to `__init__()`.  
#### This should override the twelve student roster provided in the problem statement.  
#### Both of these statements need to work with your `__init__()` method:  
####   
#### ```Python  
#### # Make a garden based on the default 12-student roster.  
#### Garden("VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV")   
####   
#### # Make a garden based on a 2-student roster.  
#### Garden("VRCC\nVCGG", students=["Valorie", "Raven"])   
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### One approach is to make the student `list` a [default argument][default argument values]; the Python docs describe `default parameters` in depth while explaining [function definitions][function definitions].  
####

#### [classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html  
#### [class vs instance objects in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects  
#### [default argument values]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values  
#### [function definitions]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a placeholder and does not implement any functionality. We need to modify the `Garden` class to implement the required functionality.

Here is the updated code for the `kindergarten_garden.py` file:

```python
class Garden:
    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        self.diagram = diagram
        self.students = students or [
            "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
            "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
            "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
        ]
        self.plants_mapping = {
            "V": "Violets",
            "R": "Radishes",
            "C": "Clover",
            "G": "Grass"
        }

    def plants(self, student):
        index = self.students.index(student) * 2
        row1 = self.diagram.split("\n")[0][index:index+2]
        row2 = self.diagram.split("\n")[1][index:index+2]
        return [self.plants_mapping[plant] for plant in row1 + row2]
```

The `Garden` class now has an `__init__` method that takes two parameters: `diagram` and `students`. The `diagram` parameter represents the layout of the garden, and the `students` parameter is an optional list of student names. If no `students` list is provided, the default list of 12 students is used.

The `plants` method takes a `student` name as an argument and returns a list of plant names belonging to that student. It calculates the index of the student in the `students` list and uses that index to extract the corresponding plants from the `diagram`. The extracted plants are then mapped to their corresponding names using the `plants_mapping` dictionary.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Based on the testing errors, it seems that the order of the plants for each student is incorrect. The expected order is different from the actual order.

To fix this, we need to modify the `plants` method in the `Garden` class to correctly retrieve the plants for each student. Currently, the method is splitting the diagram into rows and then selecting the plants based on the index of the student. However, this approach assumes that the diagram is always in the same format and that the students are in a specific order.

To make the code more flexible and handle different diagram formats and student orders, we can modify the `plants` method to use a more dynamic approach. We can create a mapping between the student names and their corresponding plant positions in the diagram. Then, we can iterate over the positions for the given student and retrieve the corresponding plants.

Here's the updated code for the `plants` method:

```python
def plants(self, student):
    student_index = self.students.index(student)
    plant_positions = [student_index * 2, student_index * 2 + 1]
    plants = []
    for row in self.diagram.split("\n"):
        for position in plant_positions:
            plants.append(self.plants_mapping[row[position]])
    return plants
```

Please replace the contents of the `kindergarten_garden.py` file with the updated code above.
