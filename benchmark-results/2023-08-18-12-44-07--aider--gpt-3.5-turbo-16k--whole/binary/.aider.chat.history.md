#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.  
####   
#### Implement binary to decimal conversion.  
#### Given a binary input string, your program should produce a decimal output.  
#### The program should handle invalid inputs.  
####   
#### ## Note  
####   
#### - Implement the conversion yourself.  
####   Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.  
####   
#### ## About Binary (Base-2)  
####   
#### Decimal is a base-10 system.  
####   
#### A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:  
####   
#### - The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1  
#### - The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10  
#### - ...  
#### - The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.  
#### - All these values are summed.  
####   
#### So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`  
####   
#### Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.  
####   
#### So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal  
#### raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + digits)  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `binary.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent, we need to implement the `parse_binary` function. Here's the updated code:

binary.py
```
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    decimal = 0
    power = len(binary_string) - 1

    for digit in binary_string:
        if digit == '0' or digit == '1':
            decimal += int(digit) * (2 ** power)
            power -= 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + binary_string)

    return decimal
```

In the updated code, we iterate over each digit in the binary string and calculate its decimal value by multiplying it with the corresponding power of 2. If any digit is not '0' or '1', we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
