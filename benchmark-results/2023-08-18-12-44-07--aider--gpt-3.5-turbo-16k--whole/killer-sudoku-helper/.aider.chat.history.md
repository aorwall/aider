#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A friend of yours is learning how to solve Killer Sudokus (rules below) but struggling to figure out which digits can go in a cage.  
#### They ask you to help them out by writing a small program that lists all valid combinations for a given cage, and any constraints that affect the cage.  
####   
#### To make the output of your program easy to read, the combinations it returns must be sorted.  
####   
#### ## Killer Sudoku Rules  
####   
#### - [Standard Sudoku rules][sudoku-rules] apply.  
#### - The digits in a cage, usually marked by a dotted line, add up to the small number given in the corner of the cage.  
#### - A digit may only occur once in a cage.  
####   
#### For a more detailed explanation, check out [this guide][killer-guide].  
####   
#### ## Example 1: Cage with only 1 possible combination  
####   
#### In a 3-digit cage with a sum of 7, there is only one valid combination: 124.  
####   
#### - 1 + 2 + 4 = 7  
#### - Any other combination that adds up to 7, e.g. 232, would violate the rule of not repeating digits within a cage.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, with three killer cages that are marked as grouped together. The first killer cage is in the 3×3 box in the top left corner of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 5. The numbers are highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The second killer cage is in the central 3×3 box of the grid. The middle column of that box forms the cage, with the followings cells from top to bottom: first cell contains a 1 and a pencil mark of 7, indicating a cage sum of 7, second cell contains a 2, third cell contains a 4. None of the numbers in this cage are highlighted and therefore don't contain any mistakes. The third killer cage follows the outside corner of the central 3×3 box of the grid. It is made up of the following three cells: the top left cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red, and a cage sum of 7. The top right cell of the cage contains a 3. The bottom right cell of the cage contains a 2, highlighted in red. All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 2: Cage with several combinations  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 19  
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
#### - 46  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. Each continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9. Second group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8. Third group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Fourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6. The last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]  
####   
#### ## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted  
####   
#### In a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:  
####   
#### - 28  
#### - 37  
####   
#### 19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.  
####   
#### ![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled. The first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1. The 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake. The last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each. From top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8. Second group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7. Third group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]

The current code in `killer_sudoku_helper.py` is just a function stub for `combinations()`. We need to implement the logic to generate all valid combinations for a given cage and any constraints that affect the cage.

Here's the updated code for `killer_sudoku_helper.py`:

killer_sudoku_helper.py
```python
from itertools import combinations

def get_valid_combinations(target, size, exclude):
    valid_combinations = []
    for combination in combinations(range(1, 10), size):
        if sum(combination) == target and not any(num in exclude for num in combination):
            valid_combinations.append(combination)
    return sorted(valid_combinations)
```

In the updated code:
- We import the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of digits.
- The `get_valid_combinations` function takes three parameters: `target` (the sum of the cage), `size` (the number of digits in the cage), and `exclude` (a list of digits that are already present in the cage or in the same row/column).
- We iterate over all combinations of digits from 1 to 9 using the `combinations` function.
- For each combination, we check if the sum of the digits is equal to the target and none of the digits are present in the `exclude` list.
- If the combination satisfies these conditions, we add it to the `valid_combinations` list.
- Finally, we return the sorted `valid_combinations` list.

This updated code will generate all valid combinations for a given cage and exclude any digits that are already present in the cage or in the same row/column.

Based on the error messages, it seems that the `combinations` function is being called with three arguments instead of two. The `combinations` function from the `itertools` module only takes two arguments: an iterable and the length of the combinations to generate.

To fix the issue, you need to update the code in `killer_sudoku_helper.py` to call the `combinations` function correctly. Here's the updated code:

killer_sudoku_helper.py
```
from itertools import combinations

def get_valid_combinations(target, size, exclude):
    valid_combinations = []
    for combination in combinations(range(1, 10), size):
        if sum(combination) == target and not any(num in exclude for num in combination):
            valid_combinations.append(list(combination))
    return sorted(valid_combinations)
```

The only change made is to convert the `combination` to a list before appending it to `valid_combinations`. This is because the `combinations` function returns tuples, but the test cases are expecting lists.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
