#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a robot simulator.  
####   
#### A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.  
####   
#### The robots have three possible movements:  
####   
#### - turn right  
#### - turn left  
#### - advance  
####   
#### Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,  
#### e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.  
####   
#### The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.  
####   
#### - The letter-string "RAALAL" means:  
####   - Turn right  
####   - Advance twice  
####   - Turn left  
####   - Advance once  
####   - Turn left yet again  
#### - Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.  
####   Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code in `robot_simulator.py` is just a placeholder and does not implement any functionality. To implement the robot simulator, we need to make the following changes:

1. Define the global variables for the directions: EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH.
2. Implement the `Robot` class with the following methods:
   - `__init__(self, direction, x_pos, y_pos)`: Initialize the robot with the given direction, x position, and y position.
   - `turn_right(self)`: Turn the robot 90 degrees to the right.
   - `turn_left(self)`: Turn the robot 90 degrees to the left.
   - `advance(self)`: Move the robot one unit forward in the current direction.
   - `get_position(self)`: Return the current position of the robot as a tuple (x, y).
   - `get_direction(self)`: Return the current direction of the robot.

Here is the updated code for `robot_simulator.py`:

robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'EAST'
NORTH = 'NORTH'
WEST = 'WEST'
SOUTH = 'SOUTH'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def turn_right(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def turn_left(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def advance(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.y_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.x_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.y_pos -= 1
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.x_pos -= 1

    def get_position(self):
        return (self.x_pos, self.y_pos)

    def get_direction(self):
        return self.direction
```

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Here is the updated content of the `robot_simulator.py` file:

robot_simulator.py
```
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'EAST'
NORTH = 'NORTH'
WEST = 'WEST'
SOUTH = 'SOUTH'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def turn_right(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def turn_left(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def advance(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.y_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.x_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.y_pos -= 1
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.x_pos -= 1

    def get_position(self):
        return (self.x_pos, self.y_pos)

    def get_direction(self):
        return self.direction

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
```

The changes made include adding a `move` method to the `Robot` class, which takes a string of instructions and performs the corresponding movements. This method is called in the test cases to verify the robot's position and direction after executing a sequence of instructions.
