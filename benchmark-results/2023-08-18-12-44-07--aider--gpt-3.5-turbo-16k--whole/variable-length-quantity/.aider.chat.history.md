#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the sequence is incomplete  
#### raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a placeholder with empty functions. We need to implement the `encode` and `decode` functions according to the instructions provided.

Here is the updated content of the `variable_length_quantity.py` file:

variable_length_quantity.py
```
def encode(numbers):
    encoded_bytes = []
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is within the valid range
        if number < 0 or number > 0xFFFFFFFF:
            raise ValueError("Number out of range: {}".format(number))
        
        # Encode the number into variable length quantity
        while True:
            # Get the least significant 7 bits of the number
            byte = number & 0x7F
            number >>= 7
            
            # Set the most significant bit if there are more bytes to follow
            if number > 0:
                byte |= 0x80
            
            # Add the byte to the encoded bytes list
            encoded_bytes.append(byte)
            
            # Break the loop if all bytes of the number have been encoded
            if number == 0:
                break
    
    return bytes(encoded_bytes)


def decode(bytes_):
    numbers = []
    number = 0
    for byte in bytes_:
        # Get the least significant 7 bits of the byte
        value = byte & 0x7F
        
        # Shift the number to the left by 7 bits and add the value
        number = (number << 7) | value
        
        # Check if the most significant bit is set
        if byte & 0x80 == 0:
            # Add the decoded number to the list
            numbers.append(number)
            number = 0
    
    return numbers
```

The `encode` function takes a list of numbers and encodes them into variable length quantities. It iterates over each number, checks if it is within the valid range, and then encodes it into a series of bytes. The encoded bytes are stored in a list and then converted to a `bytes` object before returning.

The `decode` function takes a `bytes` object and decodes it into a list of numbers. It iterates over each byte, extracts the least significant 7 bits, and appends it to the current number. If the most significant bit is not set, it means that the current number has been fully decoded and it is added to the list. The process continues until all bytes have been processed.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
