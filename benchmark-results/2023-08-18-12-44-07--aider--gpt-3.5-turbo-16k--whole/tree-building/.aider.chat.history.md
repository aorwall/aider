#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a tree building algorithm.  
####   
#### Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.  
#### However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.  
#### Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.  
####   
#### Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.  
#### The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.  
#### The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).  
#### All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.  
####   
#### An example tree:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)  
#### |-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)  
#### |    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)  
#### +-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)  
#### +-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)  
#### ```  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

I have updated the error messages in the `raise ValueError` statements to match the expected error messages in the test cases.
