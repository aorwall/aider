#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An [Armstrong number][armstrong-number] is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`  
#### - 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`  
#### - 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`  
#### - 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`  
####   
#### Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

The current code in `armstrong_numbers.py` is just a function stub without any implementation. To determine whether a number is an Armstrong number, we need to calculate the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's the updated code for `armstrong_numbers.py`:

```python
def is_armstrong_number(number):
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits
    number_str = str(number)
    
    # Get the number of digits in the number
    num_digits = len(number_str)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_digits for digit in number_str)
    
    # Check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number
    return digit_sum == number
```

This updated code calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if it is equal to the original number. If it is, then the number is an Armstrong number.

Please replace the content of `armstrong_numbers.py` with the updated code provided above.
