#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on  
#### Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.  
####   
#### The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus][nicomachus] devised a classification scheme for positive integers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of **perfect**, **abundant**, or **deficient** based on their [aliquot sum][aliquot-sum].  
#### The aliquot sum is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself.  
#### For example, the aliquot sum of 15 is (1 + 3 + 5) = 9  
####   
#### - **Perfect**: aliquot sum = number  
####   - 6 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6  
####   - 28 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14) = 28  
#### - **Abundant**: aliquot sum > number  
####   - 12 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) = 16  
####   - 24 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12) = 36  
#### - **Deficient**: aliquot sum < number  
####   - 8 is a deficient number because (1 + 2 + 4) = 7  
####   - Prime numbers are deficient  
####   
#### Implement a way to determine whether a given number is **perfect**.  
#### Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is **abundant** or **deficient**.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the `classify()` function is passed a number that is not a _positive integer_.  The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if a number to be classified is less than 1.  
#### raise ValueError("Classification is only possible for positive integers.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: perfect_numbers.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
