#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
####   
#### These colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to create a way:  
####   
#### - to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band  
#### - to list the different band colors  
####   
#### Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:  
#### Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.  
####   
#### More information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].

#### [e-color-code]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code

#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
