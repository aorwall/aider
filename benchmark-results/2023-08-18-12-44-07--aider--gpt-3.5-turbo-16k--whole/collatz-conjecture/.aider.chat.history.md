#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:  
####   
#### Take any positive integer n.  
#### If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2.  
#### If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.  
#### Repeat the process indefinitely.  
#### The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.  
####   
#### Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:  
####   
#### 0. 12  
#### 1. 6  
#### 2. 3  
#### 3. 10  
#### 4. 5  
#### 5. 16  
#### 6. 8  
#### 7. 4  
#### 8. 2  
#### 9. 1  
####   
#### Resulting in 9 steps.  
#### So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### The Collatz Conjecture is only concerned with **strictly positive integers**, so this exercise expects you to use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) and "throw" a `ValueError` in your solution if the given value is zero or a negative integer. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when argument is zero or a negative integer  
#### raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: collatz_conjecture.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The current code is just a function stub without any implementation. To solve the Collatz Conjecture problem, we need to implement the steps function. Here's the updated code:

collatz_conjecture.py
```
def steps(number):
    if number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    
    count = 0
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number = number // 2
        else:
            number = number * 3 + 1
        count += 1
    
    return count
```

In the updated code, we first check if the given number is zero or negative. If it is, we raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

Then, we initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of steps. We enter a while loop that continues until the number becomes 1. Inside the loop, we check if the number is even or odd and perform the corresponding operation. For even numbers, we divide the number by 2, and for odd numbers, we multiply the number by 3 and add 1. After each operation, we increment the count by 1.

Finally, we return the count, which represents the number of steps required to reach 1.
