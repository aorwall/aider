I see the issue. The code is not checking for the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. Let's add this check to each function.

Filepath: triangle.py
```python
def equilateral(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    if a + b < c or b + c < a or a + c < b:
        return False
    return a == b == c


def isosceles(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    if a + b < c or b + c < a or a + c < b:
        return False
    return a == b or b == c or a == c


def scalene(sides):
    a, b, c = sides
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    if a + b < c or b + c < a or a + c < b:
        return False
    return a != b and b != c and a != c
```
In each function, I added a check for the triangle inequality. If the sum of the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side, the function returns `False`. This should resolve the test failures.
