To implement the square code cipher, we need to follow these steps:

1. Normalize the input text by removing spaces, punctuation, and converting to lowercase.
2. Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle.
3. Organize the normalized text into a rectangle.
4. Read the encoded message by reading down the columns from left to right.
5. Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles, with trailing spaces for phrases that are short of the perfect rectangle.

Here's how we can implement these steps in the `cipher_text` function:

Filepath: crypto_square.py
```python
import math

def cipher_text(plain_text):
    # Step 1: Normalize the input text
    normalized_text = ''.join(c for c in plain_text.lower() if c.isalnum())

    # Step 2: Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle
    c = math.ceil(math.sqrt(len(normalized_text)))
    r = c if c * (c - 1) >= len(normalized_text) else c

    # Step 3: Organize the normalized text into a rectangle
    rectangle = [normalized_text[i:i+c] for i in range(0, len(normalized_text), c)]

    # Step 4: Read the encoded message by reading down the columns from left to right
    encoded_message = ''.join(''.join(row[j] for row in rectangle if j < len(row)) for j in range(c))

    # Step 5: Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles
    return ' '.join(encoded_message[i:i+r] for i in range(0, len(encoded_message), r))
```

In this code, we first normalize the input text by removing spaces, punctuation, and converting to lowercase. We then determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle using the square root of the length of the normalized text. We organize the normalized text into a rectangle by splitting it into chunks of length `c`. We then read the encoded message by reading down the columns from left to right. Finally, we output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles, with trailing spaces for phrases that are short of the perfect rectangle.
