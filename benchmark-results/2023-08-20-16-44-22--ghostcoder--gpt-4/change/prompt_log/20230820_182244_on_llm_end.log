To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a list `dp` of size `target + 1` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of coins required to make the change for the amount `i`. We initialize `dp[0]` to 0 as no coins are required to make the change for the amount 0. For the rest of the amounts, we initialize the `dp` list to `float('inf')` as we don't know the minimum number of coins yet.

Then, for each coin in the `coins` list, we update our `dp` list. For each amount `i` from the value of the coin to `target`, we set `dp[i]` to the minimum of the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. `dp[i - coin] + 1` represents the number of coins required to make the change for the amount `i` if we use the current coin.

Finally, if `dp[target]` is still `float('inf')`, it means we can't make the change for the `target` amount with the given coins, so we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we return `dp[target]` as the minimum number of coins required.

Filepath: change.py
```python
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Target can't be negative")
    if target > 0 and min(coins) > target:
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    dp = [0] + [float('inf')] * target
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        raise ValueError("Can't make target with given coins")

    return dp[target]
```
This function will return the minimum number of coins required to make the change for the `target` amount. If it's not possible to make the change with the given coins, it will raise a `ValueError`.
