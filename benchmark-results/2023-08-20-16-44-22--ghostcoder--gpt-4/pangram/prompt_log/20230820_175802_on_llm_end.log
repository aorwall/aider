To check if a sentence is a pangram, we need to check if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet. We can do this by creating a set of all the letters in the sentence and comparing it to a set of all the letters in the English alphabet. If the two sets are equal, then the sentence is a pangram.

Here's how we can implement this in the `is_pangram` function:

Filepath: pangram.py
```python
def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
    sentence = set(sentence.lower())
    return alphabet.issubset(sentence)
```

In this code, `alphabet` is a set of all the letters in the English alphabet. `sentence` is a set of all the letters in the sentence, converted to lower case to make the comparison case insensitive. The `issubset` method checks if all elements of `alphabet` are in `sentence`. If they are, it returns `True`, indicating that the sentence is a pangram. If not, it returns `False`.
