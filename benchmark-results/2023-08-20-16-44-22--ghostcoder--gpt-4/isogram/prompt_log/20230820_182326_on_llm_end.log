prompt:
To determine if a word or phrase is an isogram, we need to check if any character (excluding spaces and hyphens) repeats in the string. We can do this by converting the string to lowercase (since isograms are case-insensitive), removing spaces and hyphens, and then checking if the length of the set of characters is equal to the length of the string. If they are equal, it means all characters are unique and the string is an isogram.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: isogram.py
```python
def is_isogram(string):
    string = string.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('-', '')
    return len(string) == len(set(string))
```
