To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in list slicing and comparison features. 

First, we'll assign unique integer values to the constants `SUBLIST`, `SUPERLIST`, `EQUAL`, and `UNEQUAL`. These constants will be used to represent the four possible relationships between the two lists.

In the `sublist` function, we'll first check if the two lists are equal. If they are, we'll return `EQUAL`.

If the lists are not equal, we'll check if `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two` by checking if `list_one` is a slice of `list_two`. We'll do this by iterating over `list_two` and checking if `list_one` is equal to a slice of `list_two` of the same length as `list_one`. If `list_one` is a sublist of `list_two`, we'll return `SUBLIST`.

If `list_one` is not a sublist of `list_two`, we'll check if `list_one` is a superlist of `list_two` by doing the same thing but with the roles of `list_one` and `list_two` reversed. If `list_one` is a superlist of `list_two`, we'll return `SUPERLIST`.

If none of the above conditions are met, we'll return `UNEQUAL`.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: sublist.py
```python
SUBLIST = 1
SUPERLIST = 2
EQUAL = 3
UNEQUAL = 4

def sublist(list_one, list_two):
    if list_one == list_two:
        return EQUAL
    elif any(list_one == list_two[i:i+len(list_one)] for i in range(len(list_two))):
        return SUBLIST
    elif any(list_two == list_one[i:i+len(list_two)] for i in range(len(list_one))):
        return SUPERLIST
    else:
        return UNEQUAL
```

This code should correctly identify the relationship between any two lists according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
