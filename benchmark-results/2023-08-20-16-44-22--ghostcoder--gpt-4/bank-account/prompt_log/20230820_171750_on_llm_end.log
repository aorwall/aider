To implement the BankAccount class, we need to add some attributes to the class and implement the methods. 

We'll add two attributes: `open` and `balance`. The `open` attribute will be a boolean indicating whether the account is open or not. The `balance` attribute will store the current balance of the account.

In the `__init__` method, we'll initialize `open` to False and `balance` to 0.

The `get_balance` method will check if the account is open and if it is, it will return the balance. If the account is not open, it will raise a ValueError.

The `open` method will check if the account is already open and if it is, it will raise a ValueError. If the account is not open, it will set `open` to True.

The `deposit` method will check if the account is open and if the amount to deposit is greater than 0. If the account is not open or the amount is not greater than 0, it will raise a ValueError. If the account is open and the amount is greater than 0, it will add the amount to the balance.

The `withdraw` method will check if the account is open, if the amount to withdraw is greater than 0, and if the amount to withdraw is less than or equal to the balance. If any of these conditions are not met, it will raise a ValueError. If all conditions are met, it will subtract the amount from the balance.

The `close` method will check if the account is open and if it is, it will set `open` to False and `balance` to 0. If the account is not open, it will raise a ValueError.

```python
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def open(self):
        if self.open:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.open = True

    def deposit(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0')
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.open or amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
                raise ValueError('account not open or amount must be greater than 0 or amount must be less than balance')
            self.balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        if not self.open:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.open = False
        self.balance = 0
```
The `lock` attribute is a threading.Lock object that is used to ensure that only one thread can execute the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods at a time. This prevents race conditions where two threads try to update the balance at the same time.
