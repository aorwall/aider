Human: # Instructions

Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.
Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.

The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.

## Lyrics

```text
On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

## Test-driven development

 Be sure to check the comments at the top of the tests file.
 They will be helpful in understanding the expected output of your function.

This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.
However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.
For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.
For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.
What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve_days.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: twelve_days.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can create a list of tuples where each tuple represents a day of Christmas and the corresponding gift. Then, we can iterate over this list to construct the verses of the song. 

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: twelve_days.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    days = [
        ('first', 'a Partridge in a Pear Tree'),
        ('second', 'two Turtle Doves'),
        ('third', 'three French Hens'),
        ('fourth', 'four Calling Birds'),
        ('fifth', 'five Gold Rings'),
        ('sixth', 'six Geese-a-Laying'),
        ('seventh', 'seven Swans-a-Swimming'),
        ('eighth', 'eight Maids-a-Milking'),
        ('ninth', 'nine Ladies Dancing'),
        ('tenth', 'ten Lords-a-Leaping'),
        ('eleventh', 'eleven Pipers Piping'),
        ('twelfth', 'twelve Drummers Drumming')
    ]

    verses = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        verse = f"On the {days[i][0]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
        verse += ', '.join(gift for _, gift in reversed(days[:i+1]))
        verse = verse.replace('two Turtle Doves', 'two Turtle Doves, and')
        verses.append(verse)

    return verses
```
In this code, we first create a list of tuples where each tuple represents a day of Christmas and the corresponding gift. Then, we iterate over this list from the start_verse to the end_verse. For each day, we construct the verse by joining the gifts of the current day and all the previous days in reverse order. We then replace 'two Turtle Doves' with 'two Turtle Doves, and' to match the song's lyrics. Finally, we append the verse to the verses list and return this list.
