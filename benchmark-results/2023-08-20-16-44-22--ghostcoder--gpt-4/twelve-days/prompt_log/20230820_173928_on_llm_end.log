To solve this problem, we can create a list of tuples where each tuple represents a day of Christmas and the corresponding gift. Then, we can iterate over this list to construct the verses of the song. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: twelve_days.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    days = [
        ('first', 'a Partridge in a Pear Tree'),
        ('second', 'two Turtle Doves'),
        ('third', 'three French Hens'),
        ('fourth', 'four Calling Birds'),
        ('fifth', 'five Gold Rings'),
        ('sixth', 'six Geese-a-Laying'),
        ('seventh', 'seven Swans-a-Swimming'),
        ('eighth', 'eight Maids-a-Milking'),
        ('ninth', 'nine Ladies Dancing'),
        ('tenth', 'ten Lords-a-Leaping'),
        ('eleventh', 'eleven Pipers Piping'),
        ('twelfth', 'twelve Drummers Drumming')
    ]

    verses = []
    for i in range(start_verse - 1, end_verse):
        verse = f"On the {days[i][0]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: "
        verse += ', '.join(gift for _, gift in reversed(days[:i+1]))
        verse = verse.replace('two Turtle Doves', 'two Turtle Doves, and')
        verses.append(verse)

    return verses
```

In this code, we first create a list of tuples where each tuple represents a day of Christmas and the corresponding gift. Then, we iterate over this list from the start_verse to the end_verse. For each day, we construct the verse by joining the gifts of the current day and all the previous days in reverse order. We then replace 'two Turtle Doves' with 'two Turtle Doves, and' to match the song's lyrics. Finally, we append the verse to the verses list and return this list.
