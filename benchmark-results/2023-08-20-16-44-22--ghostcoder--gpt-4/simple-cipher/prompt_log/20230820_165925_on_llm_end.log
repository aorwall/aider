The issue here is that the current implementation only uses the first character of the key to determine the shift distance. However, the key can be longer than one character, and each character in the key should determine the shift distance for the corresponding character in the plaintext. 

To fix this, we need to iterate over the characters in the plaintext and the key together, using the `zip` function. If the plaintext is longer than the key, we repeat the key as many times as necessary using the `itertools.cycle` function. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: simple_cipher.py
```python
import random
import string
import itertools

class Cipher:
    def __init__(self, key=None):
        if key is None:
            self.key = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(100))
        else:
            self.key = key

    def encode(self, text):
        return ''.join(chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + ord(key_char) - ord('a')) % 26 + ord('a')) 
                       for char, key_char in zip(text, itertools.cycle(self.key)))

    def decode(self, text):
        return ''.join(chr((ord(char) - ord('a') - (ord(key_char) - ord('a')) + 26) % 26 + ord('a')) 
                       for char, key_char in zip(text, itertools.cycle(self.key)))
```
In this updated code, the `encode` and `decode` methods now iterate over the characters in the plaintext and the key together. For each pair of characters, they calculate the shift distance based on the ASCII value of the key character, and then apply the shift to the plaintext character. If the plaintext is longer than the key, the `itertools.cycle` function repeats the key as many times as necessary.
