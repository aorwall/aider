Human: # Instructions

Tally the results of a small football competition.

Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:

```text
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

What do those abbreviations mean?

- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points.
A draw earns 1.
A loss earns 0.

The outcome is ordered by points, descending.
In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

## Input

Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win
```

The result of the match refers to the first team listed.
So this line:

```text
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
```

means that the Allegoric Alaskans beat the Blithering Badgers.

This line:

```text
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
```

means that the Blithering Badgers beat the Courageous Californians.

And this line:

```text
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
```

means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tournament.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: tournament.py
AI: To solve this problem, we need to parse the input rows, update the statistics for each team, and then format the results into the desired output format. 

Here's how we can do it:

1. Create a dictionary to store the statistics for each team. The keys will be the team names, and the values will be another dictionary with keys for 'MP', 'W', 'D', 'L', and 'P'.

2. Iterate over the input rows. For each row, split the row into the two team names and the result. Update the statistics for the two teams based on the result.

3. After updating all the statistics, convert the dictionary into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a team name and its statistics.

4. Sort the list of tuples first by points in descending order, and then by team name in ascending order.

5. Format the sorted list into the desired output format.

Here's the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: tournament.py
```python
def tally(rows):
    teams = {}

    for row in rows:
        team1, team2, result = row.split(';')

        if team1 not in teams:
            teams[team1] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}
        if team2 not in teams:
            teams[team2] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}

        teams[team1]['MP'] += 1
        teams[team2]['MP'] += 1

        if result == 'win':
            teams[team1]['W'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 3
            teams[team2]['L'] += 1
        elif result == 'loss':
            teams[team2]['W'] += 1
            teams[team2]['P'] += 3
            teams[team1]['L'] += 1
        else:  # draw
            teams[team1]['D'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 1
            teams[team2]['D'] += 1
            teams[team2]['P'] += 1

    sorted_teams = sorted(teams.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1]['P'], x[0]))

    output = ['Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P']
    for team, stats in sorted_teams:
        output.append(f"{team:30} | {stats['MP']:2} | {stats['W']:2} | {stats['D']:2} | {stats['L']:2} | {stats['P']:2}")

    return '
'.join(output)
```
This function first initializes an empty dictionary to store the statistics for each team. It then iterates over the input rows, updating the statistics for the two teams in each row based on the result of the match. After updating all the statistics, it sorts the teams by points and team name, and formats the sorted list into the desired output format.
