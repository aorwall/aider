The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be implemented in Python using a list to represent the numbers from 2 up to the given limit. We start by assuming all numbers in this range are prime (represented by True in the list). Then we iterate over each number in the list, and for each number that is still marked as prime, we mark its multiples as not prime (represented by False in the list). Finally, we return the indices of the numbers that are still marked as True, which represent the prime numbers.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: sieve.py
```python
def primes(limit):
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
    for x in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[x]:
            for i in range(x*x, limit + 1, x):
                sieve[i] = False
    return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if sieve[p]]
```

In this code, `sieve` is a list of boolean values representing whether each index is prime. We start by assuming all numbers are prime (all values in `sieve` are True). The outer loop `for x in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):` iterates over each number up to the square root of the limit. The inner loop `for i in range(x*x, limit + 1, x):` marks the multiples of each prime number as not prime. Finally, the list comprehension `[p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if sieve[p]]` returns the indices of the numbers that are still marked as True, which are the prime numbers.
