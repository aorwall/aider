prompt:
To compute the prime factors of a given natural number, we can use a simple algorithm. We start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If the number is divisible by 2, we add 2 to our list of factors and continue dividing by 2 until it's no longer divisible. Then we move on to the next prime number, which is 3, and repeat the process. We continue this process until our number is reduced to 1.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: prime_factors.py
```python
def factors(value):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= value:
        if value % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            value //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if value > 1:
        factors.append(value)
    return factors
```

In this code, we start with `i = 2` and an empty list of factors. The `while` loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `value`. If `value` is not divisible by `i`, we increment `i`. If `value` is divisible by `i`, we divide `value` by `i` and add `i` to our list of factors. After the loop, if `value` is greater than 1, we add it to our list of factors. This accounts for the case where `value` is a prime number. The function then returns the list of factors.
