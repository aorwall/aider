Sure, I will implement the `encode` and `decode` functions for the rail fence cipher.

Filepath: rail_fence_cipher.py
```python
def encode(message, rails):
    message = message.replace(' ', '')
    rail = [[] for _ in range(rails)]
    num = 0
    down = False

    for char in message:
        rail[num].append(char)
        if num == 0 or num == rails - 1:
            down = not down
        num += 1 if down else -1

    result = []
    for i in rail:
        result += i
    return ''.join(result)


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    length = len(encoded_message)
    rail = [[] for _ in range(rails)]
    num = 0
    down = False

    for _ in range(length):
        rail[num].append(None)
        if num == 0 or num == rails - 1:
            down = not down
        num += 1 if down else -1

    i = 0
    for r in rail:
        for j in range(len(r)):
            if r[j] == None:
                r[j] = encoded_message[i]
                i += 1

    result = []
    num = 0
    down = False
    for _ in range(length):
        result.append(rail[num].pop(0))
        if num == 0 or num == rails - 1:
            down = not down
        num += 1 if down else -1

    return ''.join(result)
```

In the `encode` function, I first remove all spaces from the message. Then I create a list of lists (representing the rails) and iterate over the characters in the message. Depending on the current rail number and direction (down or up), I append the character to the corresponding rail and adjust the rail number and direction for the next character. Finally, I concatenate all characters from all rails to form the encoded message.

In the `decode` function, I first create a list of lists (representing the rails) with the same length as the encoded message but with all elements set to `None`. Then I iterate over the rails in the same zig-zag pattern as in the `encode` function and replace the `None` elements with the characters from the encoded message in the order they appear. Finally, I concatenate all characters from all rails in the same zig-zag pattern to form the decoded message.
