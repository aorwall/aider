prompt:
To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. The base case will be when the row count is 0, in which case we return an empty list. For the recursive case, we will calculate the previous row and then use it to calculate the current row. 

We will also add a check at the beginning of the function to raise a ValueError if the row count is negative, as per the instructions.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: pascals_triangle.py
```python
def rows(row_count):
    if row_count < 0:
        raise ValueError("number of rows is negative")
    if row_count == 0:
        return []
    elif row_count == 1:
        return [[1]]
    else:
        new_row = [1]
        last_row = rows(row_count - 1)[-1]
        new_row += [sum(pair) for pair in zip(last_row[:-1], last_row[1:])]
        new_row.append(1)
        return rows(row_count - 1) + [new_row]
```

In this code, `rows(row_count - 1)` is the recursive call to get the rows up to the previous row. The `[-1]` gets the last row of this result, which is the row above the current row we are calculating. 

The line `new_row += [sum(pair) for pair in zip(last_row[:-1], last_row[1:])]` calculates the middle numbers of the current row by adding pairs of numbers in the last row. The `zip(last_row[:-1], last_row[1:])` creates pairs of numbers from the last row.

Finally, `new_row.append(1)` adds the last 1 to the current row, and `rows(row_count - 1) + [new_row]` adds the current row to the list of previous rows.
