prompt:
The error messages indicate that the `proverb` function is receiving multiple values for the `qualifier` argument. This is likely because the tests are calling the function with `None` as the `qualifier` when it is not provided, but the function definition sets a default value of an empty string for `qualifier`. 

To fix this, we need to handle the case where `qualifier` is `None`. We can do this by checking if `qualifier` is `None` in the function and setting it to an empty string if it is. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: proverb.py
```python
def proverb(items, qualifier=None):
    qualifier = '' if qualifier is None else qualifier
    lines = [f'For want of a {x} the {y} was lost.' for x, y in zip(items, items[1:])]
    lines.append(f'And all for the want of a {qualifier + " " if qualifier else ""}{items[0]}.')
    return '\n'.join(lines)
```
In this updated code, we first check if `qualifier` is `None` and if so, we set it to an empty string. This ensures that `qualifier` is always a string, which prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when the function is called with `None` as the `qualifier`.
