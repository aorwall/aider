Human: # Instructions

Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.

The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.
Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.
The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.
The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).

Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).
Note that all games need not be "fair".
(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)

The boards look like this:

```text
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X
```

"Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.
In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: connect.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: connect.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check if there is a path from one side of the board to the other for each player. 

We start by initializing the board in the `__init__` method. We convert the input string into a list of lists for easier manipulation. 

In the `get_winner` method, we first check for a path for player 'X'. We start from every cell in the leftmost column and perform a DFS to see if we can reach the rightmost column. If we can, 'X' is the winner. 

If 'X' is not the winner, we perform a similar check for player 'O', but this time we start from every cell in the top row and try to reach the bottom row. 

The DFS is performed by the `dfs` method. It takes the current cell, the target column or row, the player, and a set of visited cells. It first checks if the current cell is out of bounds or has already been visited. If not, it marks the current cell as visited and checks if it has reached the target. If it has, it returns True. If not, it recursively calls `dfs` on all neighboring cells. 

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: connect.py
```python
class ConnectGame:
    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = [list(row) for row in board.split("
")]

    def get_winner(self):
        for i in range(len(self.board)):
            if self.dfs(i, 0, 'X', len(self.board[0])-1, set()):
                return 'X'
        for j in range(len(self.board[0])):
            if self.dfs(0, j, 'O', len(self.board)-1, set()):
                return 'O'
        return ''

    def dfs(self, i, j, player, target, visited):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(self.board) or j < 0 or j >= len(self.board[0]) or (i, j) in visited or self.board[i][j] != player:
            return False
        if (player == 'X' and j == target) or (player == 'O' and i == target):
            return True
        visited.add((i, j))
        return self.dfs(i-1, j, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i, j-1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i, j+1, player, target, visited) or \
               self.dfs(i-1, j+1, player, target, visited) or self.dfs(i+1, j-1, player, target, visited)
```
This code should correctly compute the winner of a Hex / Polygon game.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
