prompt:
To calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands, we can iterate over the characters in both strands simultaneously. If the characters at the same position in both strands are different, we increment a counter. The counter will give us the Hamming distance.

Here is the updated `hamming_distance` function:

Filepath: point_mutations.py
```python
def hamming_distance(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2):
    return sum(el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2))
```

In this function, `zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2)` generates pairs of corresponding elements from `dna_strand_1` and `dna_strand_2`. The expression `el1 != el2` is `True` if the elements are different and `False` otherwise. `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, so `sum(el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(dna_strand_1, dna_strand_2))` counts the number of differences between the strands, which is the Hamming distance.
