Because nucleic acids are\nvital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect\nthroughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very\nrare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,\nthe macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated\nresult of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.\n\nThe simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point\nmutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.\n\nBy counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands\ntaken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of\nthe minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the\nevolutionary path between the two strands.\n\nThis is called the 'Hamming distance'\n\n    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT\n    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT\n    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^\n\nThe Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.\n\n## Implementation notes\n\nThe Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. Hence you\nmay assume that only sequences of equal length will be passed to your hamming\ndistance function.\n\n**Note: This problem is deprecated, replaced by the one called `hamming`.**\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: point_mutations.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
