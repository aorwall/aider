Human: # Instructions

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

[Alphametics][alphametics] is a puzzle where letters in words are replaced with numbers.

For example `SEND + MORE = MONEY`:

```text
  S E N D
  M O R E +
-----------
M O N E Y
```

Replacing these with valid numbers gives:

```text
  9 5 6 7
  1 0 8 5 +
-----------
1 0 6 5 2
```

This is correct because every letter is replaced by a different number and the words, translated into numbers, then make a valid sum.

Each letter must represent a different digit, and the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero.

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.
