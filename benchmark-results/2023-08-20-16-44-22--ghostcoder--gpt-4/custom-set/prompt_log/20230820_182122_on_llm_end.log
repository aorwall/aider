Sure, I will implement the methods in the `CustomSet` class. 

Filepath: custom_set.py
```python
class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=[]):
        self.set = set(elements)

    def isempty(self):
        return len(self.set) == 0

    def __contains__(self, element):
        return element in self.set

    def issubset(self, other):
        return self.set.issubset(other.set)

    def isdisjoint(self, other):
        return self.set.isdisjoint(other.set)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.set == other.set

    def add(self, element):
        self.set.add(element)

    def intersection(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set.intersection(other.set))

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set - other.set)

    def __add__(self, other):
        return CustomSet(self.set.union(other.set))
```

Here's what each method does:

- `__init__`: Initializes a new instance of the `CustomSet` class. It takes an optional `elements` parameter, which should be a list. It converts this list into a set to ensure all elements are unique.

- `isempty`: Returns `True` if the set is empty (i.e., it has no elements), and `False` otherwise.

- `__contains__`: Checks if a given element is in the set. It returns `True` if the element is in the set, and `False` otherwise.

- `issubset`: Checks if the set is a subset of another set. It returns `True` if all elements of the set are in the other set, and `False` otherwise.

- `isdisjoint`: Checks if the set is disjoint with another set. It returns `True` if the sets have no elements in common, and `False` otherwise.

- `__eq__`: Checks if the set is equal to another set. It returns `True` if the sets have exactly the same elements, and `False` otherwise.

- `add`: Adds a new element to the set. If the element is already in the set, it does nothing.

- `intersection`: Returns a new `CustomSet` instance that is the intersection of the set and another set. The intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in both sets.

- `__sub__`: Returns a new `CustomSet` instance that is the difference of the set and another set. The difference of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.

- `__add__`: Returns a new `CustomSet` instance that is the union of the set and another set. The union of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in either set.
