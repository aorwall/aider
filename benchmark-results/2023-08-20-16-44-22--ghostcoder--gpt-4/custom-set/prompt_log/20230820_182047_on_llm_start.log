Human: # Instructions

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some type, like a set.
In this exercise you will define your own set.
How it works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of unique elements.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: custom_set.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: custom_set.py
```python
class CustomSet:
    def __init__(self, elements=[]):
        pass

    def isempty(self):
        pass

    def __contains__(self, element):
        pass

    def issubset(self, other):
        pass

    def isdisjoint(self, other):
        pass

    def __eq__(self, other):
        pass

    def add(self, element):
        pass

    def intersection(self, other):
        pass

    def __sub__(self, other):
        pass

    def __add__(self, other):
        pass

```
