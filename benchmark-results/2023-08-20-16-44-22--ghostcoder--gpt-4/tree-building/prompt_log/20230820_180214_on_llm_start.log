Human: # Instructions

Refactor a tree building algorithm.

Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.
However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.
Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.

Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.
The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.
The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).
All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.

An example tree:

```text
root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)
|-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)
|    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)
|    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)
+-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)
|    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)
+-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you refactor how/where the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) is used to "throw" a `ValueError` for invalid tree input. The tests will only pass if the code both `raise`s the appropriate `exception` and includes an appropriate message with it.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: tree_building.py
AI: The existing code is inefficient and unnecessarily complex. It sorts the records and then iterates over them multiple times, which is not needed. It also creates a list of ordered IDs, which is not necessary. The code also has redundant error checking.

Here's a more efficient and cleaner approach:

1. First, we'll create a dictionary where the keys are the record IDs and the values are the corresponding Node objects. This will allow us to quickly look up nodes by their ID.

2. Then, we'll iterate over the records once. For each record, we'll create a Node object and add it to the dictionary. We'll also check for errors: if the record's ID is not equal to its index in the sorted list, if the root record's parent ID is not 0, or if any record's ID is less than its parent ID, we'll raise a ValueError.

3. After that, we'll iterate over the records again. For each record, we'll find its parent node in the dictionary and add the current node to the parent's list of children.

4. Finally, we'll return the root node from the dictionary.
I updated a file.
Filepath: tree_building.py
```python
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []


def BuildTree(records):
    records.sort(key=lambda r: r.record_id)
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}

    for i, r in enumerate(records):
        if i != r.record_id or (i > 0 and r.parent_id >= r.record_id) or (i == 0 and r.parent_id != 0):
            raise ValueError('Invalid tree')

        if r.record_id != 0:
            nodes[r.parent_id].children.append(nodes[r.record_id])

    return nodes[0] if records else None
```
This code is more efficient because it only iterates over the records twice, regardless of their number. It also uses a dictionary for fast node lookups, which is more efficient than searching through a list. The error checking is also more concise and easier to understand.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in tree_building.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: tree_building.py
```python
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, parent_id):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id


class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.children = []


def BuildTree(records):
    records.sort(key=lambda r: r.record_id)
    nodes = {r.record_id: Node(r.record_id) for r in records}

    for i, r in enumerate(records):
        if i != r.record_id or (i > 0 and r.parent_id >= r.record_id) or (i == 0 and r.parent_id != 0):
            raise ValueError('Invalid tree')

        if r.record_id != 0:
            nodes[r.parent_id].children.append(nodes[r.record_id])

    return nodes[0] if records else None
```
