Human: # Introduction

You are working on a project to develop a train scheduling system for a busy railway network.

You've been asked to develop a prototype for the train routes in the scheduling system.
Each route consists of a sequence of train stations that a given train stops at.
# Instructions

Your team has decided to use a doubly linked list to represent each train route in the schedule.
Each station along the train's route will be represented by a node in the linked list.

You don't need to worry about arrival and departure times at the stations.
Each station will simply be represented by a number.

Routes can be extended, adding stations to the beginning or end of a route.
They can also be shortened by removing stations from the beginning or the end of a route.

Sometimes a station gets closed down, and in that case the station needs to be removed from the route, even if it is not at the beginning or end of the route.

The size of a route is measured not by how far the train travels, but by how many stations it stops at.

~~~~exercism/note
The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.
As the name suggests, it is a list of nodes that are linked together.
It is a list of "nodes", where each node links to its neighbor or neighbors.
In a **singly linked list** each node links only to the node that follows it.
In a **doubly linked list** each node links to both the node that comes before, as well as the node that comes after.

If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.

## How this Exercise is Structured in Python

While linked lists can be implemented in a variety of ways with a variety of underlying data structures, we ask here that you implement your linked list in an OOP fashion.

In the stub file, you will see the start of a `Node` class, as well as a `LinkedList` class.
Your `Node` class should keep track of its value, as well as which other nodes preceed or follow.
Your `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and the special method for `len` should be implemented in the `LinkedList` class.
You might also find it useful to implement a special `iter` method for iteration.

Unlike the core exercise, we will be testing error conditions by calling `pop` and `shift` on empty `LinkedLists`, so you will need to `raise` errors appropriately.

Finally, we would like you to implement `delete` in addition to the methods outlined above.
`delete` will take one argument, which is the value to be removed from the linked list.
If the value appears more than once, only the **first** occurrence should be removed.

<br>

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising]. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.
This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.
For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][error types], but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise] to "throw" a `ValueError` when a node value being `delete()`-ed is not found in the linked list.
Additionally, an `IndexError` should be thrown if there are no nodes left to `pop()`.
The tests will only pass if you both `raise` these `exceptions` and include messages with them.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# When the value passed to `delete()` is not found.
if not found:
    raise ValueError("Value not found")

```

To raise an `IndexError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# When pop() is called and there are no nodes left in the linked list
if self.length == 0:
    raise IndexError("List is empty")

```


## Special Methods in Python

The tests for this exercise will also be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.
In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.
For details on implementing special or "dunder" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.__len__(self)][__len__].

We also recommend creating a special [`__iter__`][__iter__] method to help with iterating over your linked list.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: linked_list.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: linked_list.py
AI: Sure, let's start by implementing the `Node` class. Each `Node` will have a `value` and two pointers: `succeeding` and `previous`. The `succeeding` pointer will point to the next node in the list, and the `previous` pointer will point to the previous node in the list.
I updated a file.
Filepath: linked_list.py
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, succeeding=None, previous=None):
        self.value = value
        self.succeeding = succeeding
        self.previous = previous
```
Next, let's implement the `LinkedList` class. The `LinkedList` will have a `head` and a `tail` pointer, and a `length` to keep track of the number of nodes in the list. The `head` pointer will point to the first node in the list, and the `tail` pointer will point to the last node in the list.

In the `LinkedList` class, we'll implement the following methods:

- `push`: This method will add a node to the end of the list.
- `pop`: This method will remove a node from the end of the list.
- `shift`: This method will remove a node from the beginning of the list.
- `unshift`: This method will add a node to the beginning of the list.
- `delete`: This method will remove the first occurrence of a node with a given value from the list.
- `__len__`: This method will return the number of nodes in the list.
- `__iter__`: This method will return an iterator for the list.
