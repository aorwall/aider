System: Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code. 

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment. 
* YOU MUST include the definitions of parent classes and functions.

* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

Human: # Instructions

Search files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.

The Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.
Your task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.

The `grep` command takes three arguments:

1. The string to search for.
2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.
3. One or more files to search in.

It then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.
When searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').

## Flags

The `grep` command supports the following flags:

- `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).
- `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.
- `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.
- `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grep.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: grep.py
AI: To implement the `grep` function, we will use the `re` module for regular expressions and the `os` module for file operations. 

The `grep` function will first process the flags to set up the search parameters. Then, it will iterate over the files, open each file, and search each line for the pattern. If a match is found, the line is added to the results. 

The flags are processed as follows:

- `-n`: If this flag is present, the line number will be prepended to each matching line.
- `-l`: If this flag is present, only the names of files with at least one match will be returned.
- `-i`: If this flag is present, the search will be case-insensitive.
- `-v`: If this flag is present, lines that do not match the pattern will be returned.
- `-x`: If this flag is present, only lines that exactly match the pattern will be returned.
I updated a file.
Filepath: grep.py
```python
import re
import os

def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    results = []
    line_number = '-n' in flags
    file_names_only = '-l' in flags
    case_insensitive = '-i' in flags
    invert = '-v' in flags
    whole_line = '-x' in flags

    if case_insensitive:
        pattern = pattern.lower()

    for file in files:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
                search_line = line.lower() if case_insensitive else line
                match = re.fullmatch(pattern, search_line.strip()) if whole_line else re.search(pattern, search_line)
                if (match and not invert) or (not match and invert):
                    if file_names_only:
                        results.append(file)
                        break
                    prefix = f"{file}:{i}:" if line_number else f"{file}:"
                    results.append(f"{prefix}{line.strip()}")

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grep.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: grep.py
```python
import re
import os

def grep(pattern, flags, files):
    results = []
    line_number = '-n' in flags
    file_names_only = '-l' in flags
    case_insensitive = '-i' in flags
    invert = '-v' in flags
    whole_line = '-x' in flags

    if case_insensitive:
        pattern = pattern.lower()

    for file in files:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
                search_line = line.lower() if case_insensitive else line
                match = re.fullmatch(pattern, search_line.strip()) if whole_line else re.search(pattern, search_line)
                if (match and not invert) or (not match and invert):
