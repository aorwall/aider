prompt:
To implement the PhoneNumber class, we need to clean up the input number in the constructor (__init__ method). We'll use the re (regular expressions) module to remove any non-digit characters from the input. Then, we'll check if the cleaned number is valid according to the rules provided. If it's not, we'll raise a ValueError with an appropriate message. If it is, we'll store it in the number attribute of the instance.

Filepath: phone_number.py
```python
import re

class PhoneNumber:
    def __init__(self, number):
        # Remove any non-digit characters
        cleaned = re.sub(r'\D', '', number)

        # Check the length of the cleaned number
        if len(cleaned) < 10:
            raise ValueError("must not be fewer than 10 digits")
        elif len(cleaned) > 11:
            raise ValueError("must not be greater than 11 digits")
        elif len(cleaned) == 11:
            if cleaned[0] != '1':
                raise ValueError("11 digits must start with 1")
            cleaned = cleaned[1:]

        # Check the area code and exchange code
        if cleaned[0] in '01' or cleaned[3] in '01':
            raise ValueError("area code and exchange code cannot start with zero or one")

        self.number = cleaned
```
