Sure, I will implement the `rotate` function using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The algorithm is simple: for each character in the input string, we shift it by a certain number of places as specified by the key. If the character is not a letter, we leave it as it is.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: rotational_cipher.py
```python
def rotate(text, key):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + key) % 26 + ascii_offset)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

In this code, we iterate over each character in the input text. If the character is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase), we calculate its new value after shifting. We use the ASCII value of the character to do this. The `ord` function gives us the ASCII value of a character, and `chr` gives us the character corresponding to an ASCII value.

We subtract the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' from the character's ASCII value to get a number in the range 0-25. We then add the key and take the result modulo 26 to ensure it's still in the range 0-25. Finally, we add the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' back to get the ASCII value of the shifted character.

If the character is not a letter, we simply add it to the result as it is.
