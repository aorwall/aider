To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Convert the target word and each candidate word to lowercase and sort their characters. If the sorted characters of a candidate word match the sorted characters of the target word, then the candidate word is an anagram of the target word.

2. However, we need to ensure that the candidate word is not the same as the target word (even if their case is different). Therefore, we also check that the candidate word (in its original case) is not the same as the target word (in its original case).

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: anagram.py
```python
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    sorted_word = sorted(word.lower())
    return [candidate for candidate in candidates if sorted(candidate.lower()) == sorted_word and candidate.lower() != word.lower()]
```

In this code, `sorted_word` is the sorted characters of the target word. The list comprehension iterates over each candidate word. For each candidate word, it checks if the sorted characters of the candidate word (converted to lowercase) are the same as `sorted_word` and if the candidate word (converted to lowercase) is not the same as the target word (converted to lowercase). If both conditions are true, then the candidate word is an anagram of the target word and is included in the returned list.
