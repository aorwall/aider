To solve this problem, we can use list comprehension to generate the multiples of each base value that are less than the level number. We then combine these lists into a single list, convert it to a set to remove duplicates, and finally sum the unique multiples.

Here's how you can implement this:

Filepath: sum_of_multiples.py
```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, multiples):
    # Generate the multiples of each base value that are less than the level number
    multiples_list = [i for multiple in multiples for i in range(multiple, limit, multiple)]
    # Combine these lists into a single list, convert it to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_multiples = set(multiples_list)
    # Sum the unique multiples
    return sum(unique_multiples)
```

In this code, the list comprehension `[i for multiple in multiples for i in range(multiple, limit, multiple)]` generates a list of multiples for each base value. The `range(multiple, limit, multiple)` part generates a range of numbers starting from the base value and incrementing by the base value each time, up to but not including the level number.

The `set(multiples_list)` part converts the list of multiples into a set, which automatically removes any duplicates because sets only allow unique elements.

Finally, `sum(unique_multiples)` calculates the sum of all the unique multiples.
