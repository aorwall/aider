Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.

The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.

In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.
Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).
So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.
Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.
To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.
In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.

So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.
Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.
Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:

```text
 NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY
00000000              00
00000040              40
0000007F              7F
00000080             81 00
00002000             C0 00
00003FFF             FF 7F
00004000           81 80 00
00100000           C0 80 00
001FFFFF           FF FF 7F
00200000          81 80 80 00
08000000          C0 80 80 00
0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the sequence is incomplete
raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: To implement the variable length quantity encoding and decoding, we need to follow the rules mentioned in the instructions. 

For encoding, we need to convert each number into a list of 7-bit bytes, with the most significant bit of each byte set to 1, except for the last byte, which should have the most significant bit set to 0. 

For decoding, we need to convert a list of bytes into a list of numbers. Each number is formed by concatenating the 7 least significant bits of each byte, until a byte with the most significant bit set to 0 is found.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: variable_length_quantity.py
```python
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        bytes_ = []
        while number > 127:
            bytes_.insert(0, 128 | (number & 127))
            number >>= 7
        bytes_.insert(0, number)
        result.extend(bytes_)
    return result


def decode(bytes_):
    result = []
    number = 0
    for byte in bytes_:
        number = (number << 7) | (byte & 127)
        if byte < 128:
            result.append(number)
            number = 0
    if number != 0:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    return result
```
In the `encode` function, we iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, we create a list of bytes. If the number is greater than 127, we add the 7 least significant bits of the number to the list of bytes, with the most significant bit set to 1. We then shift the number 7 bits to the right. We continue this process until the number is less than or equal to 127. Finally, we add the number to the list of bytes, with the most significant bit set to 0. We add the list of bytes to the result list.

In the `decode` function, we iterate over each byte in the input list. For each byte, we shift the current number 7 bits to the left and add the 7 least significant bits of the byte. If the most significant bit of the byte is 0, we add the number to the result list and reset the number to 0. If we reach the end of the input list and the number is not 0, we raise a `ValueError`, because the sequence is incomplete.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in variable_length_quantity.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: variable_length_quantity.py
```python
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        bytes_ = []
        while number > 127:
            bytes_.insert(0, 128 | (number & 127))
            number >>= 7
        bytes_.insert(0, number)
        result.extend(bytes_)
    return result


def decode(bytes_):
    result = []
    number = 0
    for byte in bytes_:
        number = (number << 7) | (byte & 127)
        if byte < 128:
            result.append(number)
            number = 0
    if number != 0:
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    return result
```
