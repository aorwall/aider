System: Act as a helpful Senior Developer helping a Human to write code. 

You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment. 
* YOU MUST include the definitions of parent classes and functions.

* ALL files should be presented in the following format:

Human: # Instructions

Report network IO statistics.

You are writing a [PaaS][paas], and you need a way to bill customers based on network and filesystem usage.

Create a wrapper for network connections and files that can report IO statistics.
The wrapper must report:

- The total number of bytes read/written.
- The total number of read/write operations.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: paasio.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: paasio.py
```python
import io
