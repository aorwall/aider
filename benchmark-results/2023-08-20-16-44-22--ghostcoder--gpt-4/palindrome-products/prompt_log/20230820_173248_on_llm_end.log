prompt:
The test cases are failing because they expect `None` to be returned when there are no palindrome products in the given range, but the current implementation returns `0` for `largest` and `inf` for `smallest` in such cases.

To fix this, we can initialize `max_palindrome` and `min_palindrome` to `None` and check if they are `None` before returning them. If they are `None`, it means that no palindrome products were found in the given range, so we return `None, []`. Otherwise, we return the palindrome and its factors.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: palindrome_products.py
```python
def largest(min_factor, max_factor):
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    max_palindrome = None
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and (max_palindrome is None or product >= max_palindrome):
                if max_palindrome is None or product > max_palindrome:
                    max_palindrome = product
                    factors = [(i, j)]
                elif product == max_palindrome:
                    factors.append((i, j))

    return (max_palindrome, factors) if max_palindrome is not None else (None, [])


def smallest(min_factor, max_factor):
    if min_factor > max_factor:
        raise ValueError("min must be <= max")

    min_palindrome = None
    factors = []

    for i in range(min_factor, max_factor + 1):
        for j in range(i, max_factor + 1):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and (min_palindrome is None or product <= min_palindrome):
                if min_palindrome is None or product < min_palindrome:
                    min_palindrome = product
                    factors = [(i, j)]
                elif product == min_palindrome:
                    factors.append((i, j))

    return (min_palindrome, factors) if min_palindrome is not None else (None, [])
```
In this updated code, `max_palindrome` and `min_palindrome` are initialized to `None`. When a palindrome product is found, if `max_palindrome` or `min_palindrome` is `None` or the product is greater than or equal to `max_palindrome` or less than or equal to `min_palindrome`, we update `max_palindrome` or `min_palindrome` and `factors`. If `max_palindrome` or `min_palindrome` is still `None` at the end of the function, it means that no palindrome products were found in the given range, so we return `None, []`. Otherwise, we return the palindrome and its factors.
