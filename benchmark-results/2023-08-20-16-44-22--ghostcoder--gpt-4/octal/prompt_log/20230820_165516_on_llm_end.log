prompt:
To convert an octal number to a decimal number, we can iterate over the digits in the octal number from right to left (i.e., from the least significant digit to the most significant digit). For each digit, we multiply it by 8 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 for the rightmost digit), and add the result to a running total.

We also need to handle invalid input. An octal number only contains the digits 0-7, so if the input string contains any other characters, we should treat it as octal 0.

Here's how we can implement this in the `parse_octal` function:

Filepath: octal.py
```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    if not all(char in '01234567' for char in digits):
        return 0

    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(digits)):
        decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** i)

    return decimal
```

In this code, the `all` function checks if all characters in the input string are valid octal digits. If not, it returns 0.

The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each digit in the reversed input string. The index is used as the power to raise 8 to, and the value is the digit to multiply the result by.

Finally, the result is added to the running total `decimal`, which is returned at the end of the function.
