Human: # Instructions

Convert an octal number, represented as a string (e.g. '1735263'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in or external libraries to accomplish the conversion).

Implement octal to decimal conversion.
Given an octal input string, your program should produce a decimal output.

## Note

- Implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.
- Treat invalid input as octal 0.

## About Octal (Base-8)

Decimal is a base-10 system.

A number 233 in base 10 notation can be understood
as a linear combination of powers of 10:

- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1
- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10
- ...
- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.
- All these values are summed.

So:

```text
   233 # decimal
 = 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
 = 2*100  + 3*10   + 3*1
```

Octal is similar, but uses powers of 8 rather than powers of 10.

So:

```text
   233 # octal
 = 2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 3*8^0
 = 2*64  + 3*8   + 3*1
 = 128   + 24    + 3
 = 155
```

AI: To convert an octal number to a decimal number, we can iterate over the digits in the octal number from right to left (i.e., from the least significant digit to the most significant digit). For each digit, we multiply it by 8 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 for the rightmost digit), and add the result to a running total.

We also need to handle invalid input. An octal number only contains the digits 0-7, so if the input string contains any other characters, we should treat it as octal 0.

Here's how we can implement this in the `parse_octal` function:
I updated a file.
Filepath: octal.py
```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    if not all(char in '01234567' for char in digits):
        return 0

    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(digits)):
        decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** i)

    return decimal
```
In this code, the `all` function checks if all characters in the input string are valid octal digits. If not, it returns 0.

The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each digit in the reversed input string. The index is used as the power to raise 8 to, and the value is the digit to multiply the result by.

Finally, the result is added to the running total `decimal`, which is returned at the end of the function.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in octal.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: octal.py
```python
def parse_octal(digits):
    if not all(char in '01234567' for char in digits):
        return 0

    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(digits)):
        decimal += int(digit) * (8 ** i)

    return decimal
```
