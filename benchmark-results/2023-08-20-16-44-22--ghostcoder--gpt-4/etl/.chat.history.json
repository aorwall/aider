In the given code, there is a function named `transform` which takes `legacy_data` as an argument. This `legacy_data` is a dictionary where the keys are the point values and the values are lists of letters that correspond to those point values.\n\nWe need to reverse this mapping so that each letter is a key and its point value is the value. We also need to convert all the letters to lower-case.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a dictionary comprehension. We iterate over the items in the `legacy_data` dictionary. For each item, we iterate over the letters in the list of values. For each letter, we create a new key-value pair in the new dictionary where the key is the lower-case version of the letter and the value is the point value.\n\nHere is the updated code:",
