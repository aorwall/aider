prompt:
To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we can represent each state of the buckets as a node in the graph. The edges between nodes represent the actions we can take. We start from the initial state and use BFS to explore all possible states until we find a state where one of the buckets contains the desired amount of liters.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: two_bucket.py
```python
from collections import deque

def measure(bucket_one, bucket_two, goal, start_bucket):
    # Define the initial state
    if start_bucket == 'one':
        initial_state = (bucket_one, 0)
    else:
        initial_state = (0, bucket_two)

    # Use a queue to store the states to visit
    queue = deque([(initial_state, 1)])

    # Use a set to store the visited states
    visited = set([initial_state])

    while queue:
        # Get the current state and the number of actions
        (bucket_one_content, bucket_two_content), actions = queue.popleft()

        # Check if we have reached the goal
        if bucket_one_content == goal:
            return actions, 'one', bucket_two_content
        if bucket_two_content == goal:
            return actions, 'two', bucket_one_content

        # Generate the next states
        next_states = [
            (bucket_one, bucket_two_content),  # Fill bucket one
            (bucket_one_content, bucket_two),  # Fill bucket two
            (0, bucket_two_content),  # Empty bucket one
            (bucket_one_content, 0),  # Empty bucket two
            # Pour from bucket one to bucket two
            (max(bucket_one_content - (bucket_two - bucket_two_content), 0), min(bucket_two, bucket_two_content + bucket_one_content)),
            # Pour from bucket two to bucket one
            (min(bucket_one, bucket_one_content + bucket_two_content), max(bucket_two_content - (bucket_one - bucket_one_content), 0))
        ]

        for state in next_states:
            if state not in visited:
                queue.append((state, actions + 1))
                visited.add(state)

    raise ValueError("It is not possible to reach the goal.")
```

This code first initializes the queue with the initial state and the number of actions (1, because filling the starting bucket is the first action). Then it enters a loop where it keeps taking states from the queue until it finds a state where one of the buckets contains the desired amount of liters. For each state, it generates all possible next states and adds them to the queue if they have not been visited before. If it cannot find a state where one of the buckets contains the desired amount of liters, it raises a ValueError.
