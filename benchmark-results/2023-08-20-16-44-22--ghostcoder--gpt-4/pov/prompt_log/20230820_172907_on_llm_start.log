Reparent a tree on a selected node.

A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.
That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.

This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.
For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:

```text
    +------0------+
    |      |      |
  +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+
  |   |  |   |  |   |
  4   5  6   7  8   9
```

But there is no inherent direction in a tree.
The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.
So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:

```text
        6
        |
  +-----2-----+
  |           |
  7     +-----0-----+
        |           |
      +-1-+       +-3-+
      |   |       |   |
      4   5       8   9
```

This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.
So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.

This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV
raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")

#when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.
raise ValueError("No path found")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: pov.py
AI: To solve this problem, we need to implement two methods in the Tree class: `from_pov` and `path_to`.

The `from_pov` method should reorient the tree from the perspective of the given node. This can be done by first finding the path from the root to the given node, and then rebuilding the tree from the perspective of the given node.

The `path_to` method should return the path from one node to another. This can be done by first reorienting the tree from the perspective of the start node, and then finding the path from the start node to the end node.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: pov.py
```python
from json import dumps


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, children=None):
        self.label = label
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __dict__(self):
        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}

    def __str__(self, indent=None):
        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.label < other.label

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()

    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        path = self._path_to(from_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")
        return self._from_path(path)

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        tree = self.from_pov(from_node)
        path = tree._path_to(to_node)
        if not path:
            raise ValueError("No path found")
        return [node.label for node in path]

    def _path_to(self, label, path=None):
        if path is None:
            path = []
        if self.label == label:
            return path + [self]
        for child in self.children:
            result = child._path_to(label, path + [self])
            if result:
                return result
        return None

    def _from_path(self, path):
        if not path:
            return None
        node = path[-1]
        if node in self.children:
            self.children.remove(node)
        if path[:-1]:
            self.children.append(self._from_path(path[:-1]))
        return Tree(node.label, self.children)
```
In the `_path_to` method, we recursively search for the path from the root to the given node. If the current node's label matches the given label, we return the path to the current node. Otherwise, we search in the children of the current node.

In the `_from_path` method, we recursively rebuild the tree from the given path. If the current node is in the children of the root, we remove it from the children and add the parent node to the children. Then we return a new tree with the current node as the root and the updated children.

In the `from_pov` method, we first find the path from the root to the given node, and then rebuild the tree from the path.

In the `path_to` method, we first reorient the tree from the perspective of the start node, and then find the path from the start node to the end node.
