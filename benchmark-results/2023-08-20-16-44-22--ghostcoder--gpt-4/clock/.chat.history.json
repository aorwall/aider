So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.\n\n[repr-docs]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__\n[classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n[REPL]: https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/repl/\n[ISO 8601]: https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\n\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: clock.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",

Then I calculate the actual hours and minutes that the clock should display. The `%` operator is used to ensure that the hours and minutes are within their respective ranges (0-23 for hours and 0-59 for minutes).\n\nThe `__repr__` method returns a string that represents a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object. This is useful for debugging.\n\nThe `__str__` method returns a string that represents the time in a human-readable format. The `:02d` in the format string ensures that the hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits.\n\nThe `__eq__` method checks if two Clock objects represent the same time. This is done by comparing the hours and minutes of the two objects.\n\nThe `__add__` and `__sub__` methods return a new Clock object that represents the time after adding or subtracting the given number of minutes. Note that these methods do not modify the original Clock object; they return a new object.",
