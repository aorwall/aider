```python
class Clock:
    def __init__(self, hour, minute):
        total_minutes = hour * 60 + minute
        self.minutes = total_minutes % 60
        self.hours = (total_minutes // 60) % 24

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Clock({self.hours}, {self.minutes})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.hours:02d}:{self.minutes:02d}"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.hours == other.hours and self.minutes == other.minutes

    def __add__(self, minutes):
        return Clock(self.hours, self.minutes + minutes)

    def __sub__(self, minutes):
        return Clock(self.hours, self.minutes - minutes)
```

Explanation:

In the `__init__` method, I first calculate the total minutes from the given hours and minutes. Then I calculate the actual hours and minutes that the clock should display. The `%` operator is used to ensure that the hours and minutes are within their respective ranges (0-23 for hours and 0-59 for minutes).

The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object. This is useful for debugging.

The `__str__` method returns a string that represents the time in a human-readable format. The `:02d` in the format string ensures that the hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits.

The `__eq__` method checks if two Clock objects represent the same time. This is done by comparing the hours and minutes of the two objects.

The `__add__` and `__sub__` methods return a new Clock object that represents the time after adding or subtracting the given number of minutes. Note that these methods do not modify the original Clock object; they return a new object.
