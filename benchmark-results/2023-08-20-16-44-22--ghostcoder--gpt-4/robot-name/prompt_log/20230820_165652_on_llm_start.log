Human: # Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_name.py
AI: To implement the Robot class as per the instructions, we need to generate a random name for the robot when it's turned on for the first time. We also need to ensure that the name is unique and doesn't collide with any existing robot names. 

To achieve this, we can use the `random` and `string` modules from Python's standard library. We'll generate a random name in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits. We'll also keep track of all the generated names in a class variable to ensure uniqueness.

When a robot is reset, we'll generate a new unique name for it.

Here's the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
import random
import string

class Robot:
    _names = set()

    def __init__(self):
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        while True:
            name = self._generate_random_name()
            if name not in self._names:
                break
        self._names.discard(self.name)
        self.name = name
        self._names.add(self.name)

    @staticmethod
    def _generate_random_name():
        letters = random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase, k=2)
        digits = random.choices(string.digits, k=3)
        return ''.join(letters + digits)
```
In the above code, `_names` is a class variable that keeps track of all the generated names. In the `reset` method, we generate a new unique name and update the robot's name. The `_generate_random_name` method generates a random name in the required format.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in robot_name.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
import random
import string

class Robot:
    _names = set()

    def __init__(self):
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        while True:
            name = self._generate_random_name()
            if name not in self._names:
                break
        self._names.discard(self.name)
        self.name = name
        self._names.add(self.name)

    @staticmethod
    def _generate_random_name():
        letters = random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase, k=2)
        digits = random.choices(string.digits, k=3)
        return ''.join(letters + digits)
```
