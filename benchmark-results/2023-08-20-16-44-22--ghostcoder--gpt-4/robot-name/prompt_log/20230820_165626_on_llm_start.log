Human: # Instructions

Manage robot factory settings.

When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.

The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.
The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Using random names means a risk of collisions.
Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_name.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_name.py
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

```
