This is done using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the distance we want to find, and the other two sides are the x and y coordinates.\n\nThe `if` and `elif` statements then compare this distance to the radii of the circles.

If the distance is greater than 1 but less than or equal to 5, the dart is in the middle circle and the function returns 5. If the distance is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10, the dart is in the outer circle and the function returns 1.
