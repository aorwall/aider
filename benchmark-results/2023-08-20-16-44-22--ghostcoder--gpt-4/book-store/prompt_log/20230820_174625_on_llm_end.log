prompt:
The test cases are failing because the expected values in the test cases are in cents, while the function is returning the total in dollars. To fix this, we need to return the total in cents by multiplying the total by 100.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: book_store.py
```python
def total(basket):
    discounts = [0, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25]
    total = 0
    while len(basket) > 0:
        unique_books = set(basket)
        discount = discounts[len(unique_books)]
        total += len(unique_books) * 8 * (1 - discount)
        for book in unique_books:
            basket.remove(book)
    return total * 100
```
In the updated code, we multiply the total by 100 before returning it to convert it to cents. This should fix the test cases.
