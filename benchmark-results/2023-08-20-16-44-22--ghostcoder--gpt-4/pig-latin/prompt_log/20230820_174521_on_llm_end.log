prompt:
The test case that failed is expecting "yellow" to be translated to "ellowyay". According to the rules, "y" is treated as a consonant at the beginning of a word. Therefore, it should be moved to the end before adding "ay". 

The current implementation does not handle this case correctly because it treats "y" as a vowel when it's at the beginning of a word. We need to modify the regular expressions to fix this.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: pig_latin.py
```python
import re

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated_words = []

    for word in words:
        if re.match(r'^(xr|yt|[aeiou])', word):
            translated_word = word + 'ay'
        else:
            match = re.search(r'^(qu|[^aeiou]*qu|[^aeiou]+)(.*)', word)
            if match:
                translated_word = match.group(2) + match.group(1) + 'ay'
            else:
                translated_word = word + 'ay'
        translated_words.append(translated_word)

    return ' '.join(translated_words)
```
In this updated code, I changed the regular expression in the `re.search` function from `[^aeiouy]+` to `[^aeiou]+`. This change makes the function treat "y" as a consonant when it's at the beginning of a word, which is the expected behavior according to the rules.
