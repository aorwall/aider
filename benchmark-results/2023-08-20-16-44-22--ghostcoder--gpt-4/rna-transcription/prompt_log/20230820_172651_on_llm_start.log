Human: # Introduction

You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.

Your team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.

~~~~exercism/note
It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.
That can cause all sorts of havoc.

But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.

This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].

# Instructions

Your task is determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

- `G` -> `C`
- `C` -> `G`
- `T` -> `A`
- `A` -> `U`

~~~~exercism/note
If you want to look at how the inputs and outputs are structured, take a look at the examples in the test suite.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rna_transcription.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: rna_transcription.py
```python
def to_rna(dna_strand):
    pass

```
