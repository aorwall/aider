To solve this problem, we can create a list of colors in the order given in the problem statement. This list will serve two purposes:

1. The index of each color in the list will correspond to its numerical value. This will allow us to implement the `color_code` function by simply returning the index of the given color in the list.
2. The list itself will represent the different band colors. This will allow us to implement the `colors` function by simply returning the list.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: resistor_color.py
```python
def color_code(color):
    color_list = ["black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white"]
    return color_list.index(color)


def colors():
    return ["black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white"]
```

In the `color_code` function, we use the `index` method of the list to find the index of the given color. This index is the numerical value associated with the color, so we return it.

In the `colors` function, we simply return the list of colors. This list represents the different band colors.
