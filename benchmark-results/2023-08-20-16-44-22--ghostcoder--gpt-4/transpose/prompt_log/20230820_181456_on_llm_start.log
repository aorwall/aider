Human: # Instructions

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows.
See [transpose][].

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: transpose.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in zip function, which can be used to transpose a matrix. However, the zip function stops at the shortest iterable, so we need to use itertools.zip_longest instead, which fills in missing values with a specified fill value. We will fill in missing values with spaces to match the problem requirements.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: transpose.py
```python
from itertools import zip_longest

def transpose(lines):
    return [''.join(line) for line in zip_longest(*lines, fillvalue=' ')]
```
In this code, the zip_longest function is used to transpose the input lines. The * operator is used to unpack the lines list into individual arguments for the zip_longest function. The fillvalue argument is set to ' ' so that missing values are filled with spaces.

The zip_longest function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a transposed line. The join function is used to convert these tuples into strings, and a list comprehension is used to convert the entire iterable returned by zip_longest into a list of strings.

This function will return the transposed lines as a list of strings, with each string representing a line. If the input lines have different lengths, the shorter lines will be padded with spaces on the left.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in transpose.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: transpose.py
```python
from itertools import zip_longest

def transpose(lines):
    return [''.join(line) for line in zip_longest(*lines, fillvalue=' ')]
```
