Human: # Instructions

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.
Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: difference_of_squares.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: difference_of_squares.py
```python
def square_of_sum(number):
    pass


def sum_of_squares(number):
    pass


def difference_of_squares(number):
    pass
