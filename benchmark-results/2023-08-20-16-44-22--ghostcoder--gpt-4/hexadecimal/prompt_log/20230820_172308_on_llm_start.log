Human: # Instructions

Convert a hexadecimal number, represented as a string (e.g. "10af8c"), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in or external libraries to accomplish the conversion).

On the web we use hexadecimal to represent colors, e.g. green: 008000, teal: 008080, navy: 000080).

The program should handle invalid hexadecimal strings.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: hexadecimal.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: hexadecimal.py
```python
def hexa(hex_string):
    pass

```
