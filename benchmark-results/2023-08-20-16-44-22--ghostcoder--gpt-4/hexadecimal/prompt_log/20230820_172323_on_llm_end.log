Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can convert a hexadecimal number to its decimal equivalent using first principles:

1. First, we need to reverse the hexadecimal string because the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in hexadecimal has the weight of 16^0, the next one has the weight of 16^1, and so on.

2. Then, we iterate over each character in the reversed hexadecimal string. For each character, we calculate its decimal equivalent. If the character is a digit from 0 to 9, its decimal equivalent is the same as its value. If the character is a letter from 'a' to 'f' or 'A' to 'F', its decimal equivalent is 10 to 15.

3. We multiply the decimal equivalent of each character by 16 raised to the power of its position in the reversed string (which is the index of the character in the loop) and add it to the result.

4. If the hexadecimal string contains any character that is not a valid hexadecimal digit, we raise a ValueError.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: hexadecimal.py
```python
def hexa(hex_string):
    hex_string = hex_string.lower()
    hex_digits = '0123456789abcdef'
    decimal = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(hex_string)):
        if digit not in hex_digits:
            raise ValueError("Invalid hexadecimal string")
        decimal += hex_digits.index(digit) * (16 ** i)
    return decimal
```
This function will convert a hexadecimal string to its decimal equivalent using first principles. It will raise a ValueError if the hexadecimal string contains any invalid characters.
