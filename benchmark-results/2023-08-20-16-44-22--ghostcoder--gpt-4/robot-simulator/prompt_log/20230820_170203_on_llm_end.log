To implement the robot simulator, we need to define the directions as constants and then use them in the Robot class. We also need to implement the movements of the robot. 

Here's how we can do it:

Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'EAST'
NORTH = 'NORTH'
WEST = 'WEST'
SOUTH = 'SOUTH'

# Define the movements for each direction
MOVEMENTS = {
    NORTH: (0, 1),
    EAST: (1, 0),
    SOUTH: (0, -1),
    WEST: (-1, 0)
}

# Define the turns for each direction
TURNS = {
    'R': {NORTH: EAST, EAST: SOUTH, SOUTH: WEST, WEST: NORTH},
    'L': {NORTH: WEST, WEST: SOUTH, SOUTH: EAST, EAST: NORTH}
}


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x=0, y=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.coordinates = (x, y)

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction in 'LR':
                self.direction = TURNS[instruction][self.direction]
            elif instruction == 'A':
                dx, dy = MOVEMENTS[self.direction]
                x, y = self.coordinates
                self.coordinates = (x + dx, y + dy)
```

In this code, we first define the directions as constants. Then, we define the movements for each direction in the MOVEMENTS dictionary. For example, if the robot is facing north and it advances, it will move one unit up in the y direction, hence the movement is (0, 1).

Next, we define the turns for each direction in the TURNS dictionary. For example, if the robot is facing north and it turns right, it will now face east.

In the Robot class, we initialize the robot with a direction and coordinates. The move method takes a string of instructions and executes them. If the instruction is 'L' or 'R', the robot turns in the corresponding direction. If the instruction is 'A', the robot advances in the direction it is currently facing. The new coordinates are calculated by adding the movement for the current direction to the current coordinates.
