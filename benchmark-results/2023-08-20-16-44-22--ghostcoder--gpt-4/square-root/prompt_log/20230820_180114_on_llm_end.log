The issue here is that the Babylonian method returns a float value with a precision of 0.000001, but the tests are expecting an integer value. To fix this, we can round the result to the nearest integer before returning it. 

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    x = number
    y = 1
    precision = 0.000001  # Define the precision to which we want to calculate the square root

    while x - y > precision:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x

    return round(x)
```
In this updated code, we use the built-in `round()` function to round the result to the nearest integer before returning it. This should resolve the test failures.
