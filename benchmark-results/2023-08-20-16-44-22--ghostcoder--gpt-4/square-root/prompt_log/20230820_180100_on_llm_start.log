Human: # Instructions

Given a natural radicand, return its square root.

Note that the term "radicand" refers to the number for which the root is to be determined.
That is, it is the number under the root symbol.

Check out the Wikipedia pages on [square root][square-root] and [methods of computing square roots][computing-square-roots].

Recall also that natural numbers are positive real whole numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and up).

## How this Exercise is Structured in Python


Python offers a wealth of mathematical functions in the form of the [math module][math-module] and built-ins such as [`pow()`][pow] and [`sum()`][sum].
However, we'd like you to consider the challenge of solving this exercise without those built-ins or modules.

While there is a mathematical formula that will find the square root of _any_ number, we have gone the route of only testing [natural numbers][nautral-number] (positive integers).

AI: To find the square root of a number without using built-in functions or modules, we can use the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method). This method is an iterative algorithm that can be used to find the square root of a number to a desired precision.

Here's how it works:

1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the actual square root of the given number, the better).
2. Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
   a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
   b) Set y = number / x

Here's the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    x = number
    y = 1
    precision = 0.000001  # Define the precision to which we want to calculate the square root

    while x - y > precision:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x

    return x
```
In this code, we first check if the number is 0 or 1, because the square root of 0 and 1 is the number itself. Then we initialize x with the number and y with 1. We define a precision to which we want to calculate the square root. We then enter a loop that continues until the difference between x and y is less than the defined precision. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the next approximation for the square root and update x and y accordingly. Finally, we return the calculated square root.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in square_root.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: square_root.py
```python
def square_root(number):
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    x = number
    y = 1
    precision = 0.000001  # Define the precision to which we want to calculate the square root

    while x - y > precision:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x

    return x
```
