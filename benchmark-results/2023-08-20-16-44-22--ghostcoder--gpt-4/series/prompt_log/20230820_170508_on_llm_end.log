Sure, I can help with that. The function `slices()` needs to take a string of digits as input, along with a length, and return all contiguous substrings of that length. If the length is zero, negative, or greater than the length of the series, it should raise a `ValueError`.

Here's how we can implement this:

Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    if length > len(series) or length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Length must be positive and less than or equal to the length of the series.")
    return [series[i:i+length] for i in range(len(series) - length + 1)]
```

In this function, we first check if the length is valid. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message. If the length is valid, we use a list comprehension to generate all substrings of the given length. We use the range `len(series) - length + 1` to ensure that we don't go past the end of the series. For each index `i` in this range, we take the slice of the series from `i` to `i+length`. This gives us all the contiguous substrings of the given length.
