Human: # Instructions

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions* in the input;
the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the series and/or length parameters input into the `slice()` function are empty or out of range. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the slice length is zero.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be zero")

# if the slice length is negative.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be negative")

# if the series provided is empty.
raise ValueError("series cannot be empty")

# if the slice length is longer than the series.
raise ValueError("slice length cannot be greater than series length")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: series.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: series.py
AI: Sure, I can help with that. The function `slices()` needs to take a string of digits as input, along with a length, and return all contiguous substrings of that length. If the length is zero, negative, or greater than the length of the series, it should raise a `ValueError`.

Here's how we can implement this:
I updated a file.
Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    if length > len(series) or length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Length must be positive and less than or equal to the length of the series.")
    return [series[i:i+length] for i in range(len(series) - length + 1)]
```
In this function, we first check if the length is valid. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message. If the length is valid, we use a list comprehension to generate all substrings of the given length. We use the range `len(series) - length + 1` to ensure that we don't go past the end of the series. For each index `i` in this range, we take the slice of the series from `i` to `i+length`. This gives us all the contiguous substrings of the given length.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in series.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: series.py
```python
def slices(series, length):
    if length > len(series) or length <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Length must be positive and less than or equal to the length of the series.")
    return [series[i:i+length] for i in range(len(series) - length + 1)]
```
