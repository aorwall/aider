Human: # Introduction

You plan to build a tree house in the woods near your house so that you can watch the sun rise and set.

You've obtained data from a local survey company that show the height of every tree in each rectangular section of the map.
You need to analyze each grid on the map to find good trees for your tree house.

A good tree is both:

- taller than every tree to the east and west, so that you have the best possible view of the sunrises and sunsets.
- shorter than every tree to the north and south, to minimize the amount of tree climbing.
# Instructions

Your task is to find the potential trees where you could build your tree house.

The data company provides the data as grids that show the heights of the trees.
The rows of the grid represent the east-west direction, and the columns represent the north-south direction.

An acceptable tree will be the largest in its row, while being the smallest in its column.

A grid might not have any good trees at all.
Or it might have one, or even several.

Here is a grid that has exactly one candidate tree.

```text
    1  2  3  4
  |-----------
1 | 9  8  7  8
2 | 5  3  2  4  <--- potential tree house at row 2, column 1, for tree with height 5
3 | 6  6  7  1
```

- Row 2 has values 5, 3, 2, and 4. The largest value is 5.
- Column 1 has values 9, 5, and 6. The smallest value is 5.

So the point at `[2, 1]` (row: 2, column: 1) is a great spot for a tree house.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the `matrix` is irregular. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# if the matrix is irregular
raise ValueError("irregular matrix")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: saddle_points.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: saddle_points.py
AI: To solve this problem, we need to iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, we check if it's the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column. If it is, we add its coordinates to the list of saddle points.

Here's how we can implement this:
I updated a file.
Filepath: saddle_points.py
```python
def saddle_points(matrix):
    if any(len(row) != len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("irregular matrix")

    points = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
                points.append((i, j))
    return points
```
In the code above, we first check if the matrix is irregular. If it is, we raise a ValueError with a meaningful message. Then we initialize an empty list `points` to store the coordinates of the saddle points.

We use two nested loops to iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, we check if it's the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column. If it is, we add its coordinates to the list of saddle points.

Finally, we return the list of saddle points.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in saddle_points.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: saddle_points.py
```python
def saddle_points(matrix):
    if any(len(row) != len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("irregular matrix")

    points = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == max(row) and value == min(col[j] for col in matrix):
                points.append((i, j))
    return points
```
