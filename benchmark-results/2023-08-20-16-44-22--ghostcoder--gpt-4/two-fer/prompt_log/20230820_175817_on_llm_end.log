prompt:
The function `two_fer` needs to return a string based on the input `name`. If `name` is not provided or is empty, the function should return "One for you, one for me.". If `name` is provided, the function should return "One for {name}, one for me.".

To implement this, we can use a conditional statement to check if `name` is provided. If it is, we return the string with the name. If it's not, we return the string with "you". 

We can use Python's f-string formatting to insert the name into the string. F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: two_fer.py
```python
def two_fer(name=None):
    if name:
        return f"One for {name}, one for me."
    else:
        return "One for you, one for me."
```
