Sure, I will implement the `Character` class with the following methods:

- `__init__`: This method will initialize the character with six abilities and initial hitpoints.
- `ability`: This method will simulate the rolling of four 6-sided dice and return the sum of the largest three dice.
- `modifier`: This method will calculate the constitution modifier.

Filepath: dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.ability()
        self.dexterity = self.ability()
        self.constitution = self.ability()
        self.intelligence = self.ability()
        self.wisdom = self.ability()
        self.charisma = self.ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.modifier(self.constitution)

    def ability(self):
        return sum(sorted(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4))[1:])

    @staticmethod
    def modifier(constitution):
        return (constitution - 10) // 2
```

In the `__init__` method, I'm assigning the result of the `ability` method to each of the six abilities. The `ability` method simulates the rolling of four 6-sided dice, sorts the results, discards the smallest one (by slicing the list starting from index 1), and returns the sum of the remaining three. The `modifier` method calculates the constitution modifier as per the given formula. The hitpoints are then calculated using the constitution modifier and added to the initial 10 hitpoints.
