Human: # Instructions

Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the count.

The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters.
A mine is represented by an asterisk (`*`) character.

If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.

## Examples

For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):

```text
·*·*·
··*··
··*··
·····
```

And your code will transform it into this:

```text
1*3*1
13*31
·2*2·
·111·
```
# Instructions append

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the `board()` function receives malformed input. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# when the board receives malformed input
raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: minesweeper.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement the `annotate` function in the `minesweeper.py` file. 

The idea is to iterate over each cell in the minefield. If the cell is a mine, we skip it. If it's not a mine, we count the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding it (if they exist) and replace the cell with that count. If the count is 0, we leave the cell as a blank space.
I updated a file.
Filepath: minesweeper.py
```python
def annotate(minefield):
    # Check if minefield is empty
    if not minefield:
        return []

    # Get the dimensions of the minefield
    rows, cols = len(minefield), len(minefield[0])

    # Check if minefield is malformed
    for row in minefield:
        if len(row) != cols:
            raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")

    # Initialize the result with the same dimensions as the minefield
    result = [[' ']*cols for _ in range(rows)]

    # Iterate over each cell in the minefield
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If the cell is a mine, skip it
            if minefield[i][j] == '*':
                continue

            # Count the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding the current cell
            count = 0
            for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(rows, i+2)):
                for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(cols, j+2)):
                    if minefield[x][y] == '*':
                        count += 1

            # Replace the cell with the count if it's not 0
            if count != 0:
                result[i][j] = str(count)

    # Convert each row in the result to a string
    result = [''.join(row) for row in result]

    return result
```
This function first checks if the minefield is empty or malformed. If it's not, it initializes the result with the same dimensions as the minefield. It then iterates over each cell in the minefield. If the cell is a mine, it skips it. If it's not a mine, it counts the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding it (if they exist) and replaces the cell with that count. If the count is 0, it leaves the cell as a blank space. Finally, it converts each row in the result to a string and returns the result.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
