I see the issue. The current implementation is replacing the mines with the count of adjacent mines, but it should leave the mines as they are. 

Let's modify the code to keep the mines in their place and only replace the empty cells with the count of adjacent mines.

Here's the updated `annotate` function:

Filepath: minesweeper.py
```python
def annotate(minefield):
    # Check if minefield is empty
    if not minefield:
        return []

    # Get the dimensions of the minefield
    rows, cols = len(minefield), len(minefield[0])

    # Check if minefield is malformed
    for row in minefield:
        if len(row) != cols:
            raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")

    # Initialize the result with the same dimensions as the minefield
    result = [[' ']*cols for _ in range(rows)]

    # Iterate over each cell in the minefield
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If the cell is a mine, copy it to the result
            if minefield[i][j] == '*':
                result[i][j] = '*'
                continue

            # Count the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding the current cell
            count = 0
            for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(rows, i+2)):
                for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(cols, j+2)):
                    if minefield[x][y] == '*':
                        count += 1

            # Replace the cell with the count if it's not 0
            if count != 0:
                result[i][j] = str(count)

    # Convert each row in the result to a string
    result = [''.join(row) for row in result]

    return result
```
In this updated function, if the cell is a mine, we copy it to the result and continue to the next cell. This way, the mines are preserved in their original places.
