Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement the `annotate` function in the `minesweeper.py` file. 

The idea is to iterate over each cell in the minefield. If the cell is a mine, we skip it. If it's not a mine, we count the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding it (if they exist) and replace the cell with that count. If the count is 0, we leave the cell as a blank space.

Filepath: minesweeper.py
```python
def annotate(minefield):
    # Check if minefield is empty
    if not minefield:
        return []

    # Get the dimensions of the minefield
    rows, cols = len(minefield), len(minefield[0])

    # Check if minefield is malformed
    for row in minefield:
        if len(row) != cols:
            raise ValueError("The board is invalid with current input.")

    # Initialize the result with the same dimensions as the minefield
    result = [[' ']*cols for _ in range(rows)]

    # Iterate over each cell in the minefield
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If the cell is a mine, skip it
            if minefield[i][j] == '*':
                continue

            # Count the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding the current cell
            count = 0
            for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(rows, i+2)):
                for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(cols, j+2)):
                    if minefield[x][y] == '*':
                        count += 1

            # Replace the cell with the count if it's not 0
            if count != 0:
                result[i][j] = str(count)

    # Convert each row in the result to a string
    result = [''.join(row) for row in result]

    return result
```

This function first checks if the minefield is empty or malformed. If it's not, it initializes the result with the same dimensions as the minefield. It then iterates over each cell in the minefield. If the cell is a mine, it skips it. If it's not a mine, it counts the number of mines in the 8 cells surrounding it (if they exist) and replaces the cell with that count. If the count is 0, it leaves the cell as a blank space. Finally, it converts each row in the result to a string and returns the result.
