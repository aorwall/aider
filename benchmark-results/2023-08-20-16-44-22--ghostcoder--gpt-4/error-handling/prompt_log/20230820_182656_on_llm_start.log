Human: # Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
# Hints

For the `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception` function, the `filelike_object`
will be an instance of a custom `FileLike` class defined in the test suite. This
class implements the following methods:
- `open` and `close`, for explicit opening and closing.
- `__enter__` and `__exit__`, for implicit opening and closing.
- `do_something`, which may or may not throw an `Exception`.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: error_handling.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: error_handling.py
AI: Here are the updated functions in the error_handling.py file.
I updated a file.
Filepath: error_handling.py
```python
def handle_error_by_throwing_exception():
    raise Exception("An error occurred")


def handle_error_by_returning_none(input_data):
    try:
        return int(input_data)
    except ValueError:
        return None


def handle_error_by_returning_tuple(input_data):
    try:
        return True, int(input_data)
    except ValueError:
        return False, None


def filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception(filelike_object):
    try:
        filelike_object.open()
        filelike_object.do_something()
    except Exception:
        if not filelike_object.is_closed():
            filelike_object.close()
        raise
    else:
        filelike_object.close()
```
Here's what each function does:

1. `handle_error_by_throwing_exception`: This function simply raises an exception. This is useful when you want the program to stop if an error occurs.

2. `handle_error_by_returning_none`: This function tries to convert the input data to an integer. If it fails (because the input is not a number), it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `None`.

3. `handle_error_by_returning_tuple`: This function is similar to the previous one, but instead of returning `None` when an error occurs, it returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful, and the second element is the result of the operation (or `None` if it failed).

4. `filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception`: This function tries to open a file-like object, do something with it, and then close it. If an error occurs at any point, it catches the exception, ensures that the file-like object is closed, and then re-raises the exception. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up even when errors occur.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in error_handling.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: error_handling.py
```python
def handle_error_by_throwing_exception():
    raise Exception("An error occurred")


def handle_error_by_returning_none(input_data):
    try:
        return int(input_data)
    except ValueError:
        return None


def handle_error_by_returning_tuple(input_data):
    try:
        return True, int(input_data)
    except ValueError:
        return False, None


def filelike_objects_are_closed_on_exception(filelike_object):
    try:
        filelike_object.open()
        filelike_object.do_something()
    except Exception:
        if not filelike_object.is_closed():
            filelike_object.close()
        raise
    else:
        filelike_object.close()
```
