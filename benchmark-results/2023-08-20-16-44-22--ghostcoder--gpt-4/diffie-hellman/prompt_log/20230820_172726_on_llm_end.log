Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can implement the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python using the provided function stubs.

Filepath: diffie_hellman.py
```python
import random

def private_key(p):
    return random.randint(2, p - 1)

def public_key(p, g, private):
    return (g ** private) % p

def secret(p, public, private):
    return (public ** private) % p
```

In the `private_key` function, we generate a random integer between 2 and p - 1. This will be the private key for Alice or Bob.

In the `public_key` function, we calculate the public key using the formula `g ** private mod p`. This public key is then shared with the other party.

Finally, in the `secret` function, we calculate the shared secret key using the formula `public ** private mod p`. This will result in the same value for both Alice and Bob, giving them a shared secret key.
