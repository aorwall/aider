The `recite` function needs to generate the nursery rhyme from the `start_verse` to the `end_verse`. To do this, we can create a list of all the verses in the rhyme and then use list slicing to get the verses we need. 

We can then join these verses together with newlines to create the final rhyme. 

Here's how you can implement this:

Filepath: house.py
```python
def recite(start_verse, end_verse):
    verses = [
        'This is the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.',
        'This is the horse and the hound and the horn\nthat belonged to the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.'
    ]
    return '\n\n'.join(verses[start_verse - 1:end_verse])
```

In this code, we first define all the verses of the rhyme in a list. Then, we use the `join` method to concatenate all the verses from `start_verse` to `end_verse` with two newlines in between each verse. The `- 1` in the slicing is because list indices in Python start at 0, but the verses are numbered starting from 1.
