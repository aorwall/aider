Human: # Instructions

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last letter of each word.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_search.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: word_search.py
AI: Sure, I will modify the `Point` class to initialize `x` and `y` with the provided parameters. Then, I will implement the `WordSearch` class. In the `__init__` method, I will store the puzzle as a list of lists for easier access. In the `search` method, I will iterate over the puzzle in all possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to find the word. If the word is found, I will return the start and end points.
I updated a file.
Filepath: word_search.py
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y


class WordSearch:
    def __init__(self, puzzle):
        self.puzzle = [list(row) for row in puzzle]

    def search(self, word):
        for y in range(len(self.puzzle)):
            for x in range(len(self.puzzle[y])):
                if self.search_from(x, y, word):
                    return Point(x, y), Point(x + len(word) - 1, y)
        return None

    def search_from(self, x, y, word):
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]:
            if self.search_in_direction(x, y, dx, dy, word):
                return True
        return False

    def search_in_direction(self, x, y, dx, dy, word):
        for i in range(len(word)):
            nx, ny = x + i * dx, y + i * dy
            if not (0 <= nx < len(self.puzzle[0]) and 0 <= ny < len(self.puzzle)):
                return False
            if self.puzzle[ny][nx] != word[i]:
                return False
        return True
```
In the `search_from` method, I iterate over all possible directions. For each direction, I call `search_in_direction` to check if the word can be found in that direction starting from the current point. If the word is found, I return `True`.

In the `search_in_direction` method, I iterate over the characters of the word. For each character, I calculate the next point in the given direction and check if it's within the bounds of the puzzle and if it matches the current character of the word. If all characters match, I return `True`. If any character doesn't match or if I go out of bounds, I return `False`.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in word_search.py to resolve the errors.
