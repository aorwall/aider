prompt:
To determine if a year is a leap year, we need to check if it is divisible by 4, not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400. We can use the modulus operator (%) in Python to check for divisibility. If year % 4 is 0, then the year is divisible by 4. If year % 100 is 0, then the year is divisible by 100. If year % 400 is 0, then the year is divisible by 400. 

We can use these checks in combination with logical operators to implement the leap year rules. If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Here is the updated leap.py file:

Filepath: leap.py
```python
def leap_year(year):
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

This function will return True if the year is a leap year and False otherwise.
