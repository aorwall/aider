Human: # Instructions

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.
1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

## Notes

Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: leap.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
