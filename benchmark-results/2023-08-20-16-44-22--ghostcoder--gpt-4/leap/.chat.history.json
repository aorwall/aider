We can use the modulus operator (%) in Python to check for divisibility. If year % 4 is 0, then the year is divisible by 4. If year % 100 is 0, then the year is divisible by 100. If year % 400 is 0, then the year is divisible by 400. \n\nWe can use these checks in combination with logical operators to implement the leap year rules.
