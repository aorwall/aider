To solve this problem, we need to map the colors to their corresponding values, concatenate the first two values, and then append the number of zeros indicated by the third color. We also need to handle the case where the resistance value is 1000 or more, in which case we should use the "kiloohms" unit instead of "ohms".

Here's how we can implement this:

Filepath: resistor_color_trio.py
```python
def label(colors):
    color_codes = {
        "black": 0,
        "brown": 1,
        "red": 2,
        "orange": 3,
        "yellow": 4,
        "green": 5,
        "blue": 6,
        "violet": 7,
        "grey": 8,
        "white": 9
    }

    value = (color_codes[colors[0]] * 10 + color_codes[colors[1]]) * (10 ** color_codes[colors[2]])

    if value >= 1000:
        return f"{value // 1000} kiloohms"
    else:
        return f"{value} ohms"
```

In this code, we first define a dictionary `color_codes` that maps each color to its corresponding value. Then, we calculate the resistance value by multiplying the first color's value by 10, adding the second color's value, and then multiplying the result by 10 raised to the power of the third color's value. This gives us the resistance value in ohms.

If the resistance value is 1000 or more, we divide it by 1000 and append "kiloohms" to the result. Otherwise, we simply append "ohms" to the resistance value. The `f-string` syntax is used to format the output string.
