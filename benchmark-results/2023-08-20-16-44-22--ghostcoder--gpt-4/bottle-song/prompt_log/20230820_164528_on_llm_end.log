The test failures are due to the fact that the song lyrics are expected to be in words (e.g., "Ten" instead of "10"), but the current implementation uses numeric values. 

To fix this, we can create a dictionary that maps numbers to their corresponding words. Then, we can use this dictionary to convert the numeric values to words in the song lyrics.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: bottle_song.py
```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    num_to_word = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', 5: 'five',
                   6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', 9: 'nine', 10: 'ten'}
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, 0, -take):
        word_i = num_to_word[i].capitalize() if i == start else num_to_word[i]
        word_take = num_to_word[take]
        word_remaining = 'no' if i-take == 0 else num_to_word[i-take]
        lyrics.append(f"{word_i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"{word_i} green bottle{'s' if i > 1 else ''} hanging on the wall,")
        lyrics.append(f"And if {word_take} green bottle{'s' if take > 1 else ''} should accidentally fall,")
        lyrics.append(f"There'll be {word_remaining} green bottle{'s' if i-take > 1 else ' no' if i-take == 0 else ''} hanging on the wall.")
    return lyrics
```
In this updated code, `num_to_word` is a dictionary that maps numbers to their corresponding words. `word_i`, `word_take`, and `word_remaining` are the word equivalents of `i`, `take`, and `i-take`, respectively. These word equivalents are used in the song lyrics instead of the numeric values. The `.capitalize()` method is used to capitalize the first word of the song.
