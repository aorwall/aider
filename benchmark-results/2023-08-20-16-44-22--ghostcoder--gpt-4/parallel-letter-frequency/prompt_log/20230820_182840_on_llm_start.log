Human: # Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: parallel_letter_frequency.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
AI: To implement parallel computation in Python, we can use the `multiprocessing` module which allows for the creation of separate processes. 

In the updated `parallel_letter_frequency.py` file, we first import the `Counter` class from the `collections` module and the `Pool` class from the `multiprocessing` module. 

The `calculate` function is updated to create a pool of worker processes. Each worker process is given a portion of the input text to process. The `map` method of the `Pool` class is used to apply the `Counter` function to each portion of the input text. The results are then combined into a single `Counter` object which is returned by the function.
I updated a file.
Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
from collections import Counter
from multiprocessing import Pool

def calculate(text_input):
    with Pool() as pool:
        counts = pool.map(Counter, text_input)
    return sum(counts, Counter())
```
In this code, `Pool()` creates a pool of worker processes. `pool.map(Counter, text_input)` applies the `Counter` function to each element of `text_input` in parallel. The results are then combined into a single `Counter` object with `sum(counts, Counter())`.

This code assumes that `text_input` is a list of strings. Each string is processed in a separate process. The `Counter` function counts the frequency of each letter in a string. The `sum` function is used to combine the `Counter` objects returned by the worker processes into a single `Counter` object. The second argument to `sum`, `Counter()`, is a start value for the sum.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in parallel_letter_frequency.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: parallel_letter_frequency.py
```python
from collections import Counter
from multiprocessing import Pool

def calculate(text_input):
    with Pool() as pool:
        counts = pool.map(Counter, text_input)
    return sum(counts, Counter())
```
