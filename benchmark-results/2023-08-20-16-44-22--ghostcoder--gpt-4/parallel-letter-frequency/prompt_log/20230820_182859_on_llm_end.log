prompt:
The test failures indicate that the function is not correctly handling case insensitivity, numbers, and punctuation. 

To fix these issues, we need to modify the `calculate` function to only count alphabetic characters and to treat upper and lower case letters as the same. 

We can do this by adding a new function `count_letters` that takes a string, converts it to lower case, filters out non-alphabetic characters, and then counts the frequency of each letter. This function is then used in the `pool.map` call instead of `Counter`.

Here is the updated `parallel_letter_frequency.py` file:

```python
from collections import Counter
from multiprocessing import Pool

def count_letters(text):
    return Counter(char.lower() for char in text if char.isalpha())

def calculate(text_input):
    with Pool() as pool:
        counts = pool.map(count_letters, text_input)
    return sum(counts, Counter())
```

In this updated code, `count_letters` is a new function that takes a string, converts it to lower case with `char.lower()`, checks if the character is alphabetic with `char.isalpha()`, and then counts the frequency of each letter with `Counter`. This function is used in the `pool.map` call in the `calculate` function instead of `Counter`. This ensures that only alphabetic characters are counted and that upper and lower case letters are treated as the same.
