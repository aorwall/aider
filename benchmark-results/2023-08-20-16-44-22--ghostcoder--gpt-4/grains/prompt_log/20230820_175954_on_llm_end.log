Sure, I can help with that. 

The problem can be solved using the concept of geometric progression. In a geometric progression, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2.

For the `square` function, we can calculate the number of grains on a given square by raising 2 to the power of (number - 1). We subtract 1 because the first square should have 1 grain, which is 2 to the power of 0.

For the `total` function, we can calculate the total number of grains on the chessboard by summing the geometric progression. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a is 1, r is 2, and n is 64.

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: grains.py
```python
def square(number):
    if not 1 <= number <= 64:
        raise ValueError("square must be between 1 and 64")
    return 2 ** (number - 1)


def total():
    return sum(square(i) for i in range(1, 65))
```

In the `square` function, I added a check to ensure that the input number is between 1 and 64. If it's not, the function raises a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

In the `total` function, I used a generator expression to generate the number of grains on each square from 1 to 64, and then used the `sum` function to calculate the total number of grains.
