Human: # Instructions

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.
Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: diamond.py
AI: To solve this problem, we can use the ASCII value of the letters. The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and for 'Z' is 90. We can use this information to calculate the number of rows and columns for the diamond. 

The number of rows and columns for the diamond is 2 * (ASCII value of input letter - ASCII value of 'A') + 1. 

We can then iterate over each row and column and calculate the letter to be printed at that position. If the absolute value of the difference between the row number and the column number is equal to the ASCII value of the input letter - ASCII value of 'A', we print the letter, otherwise we print a space.

Here is the updated code:
I updated a file.
Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    size = 2 * (ord(letter) - ord('A')) + 1
    diamond = [[' ' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    
    for row in range(size):
        for col in range(size):
            diff = abs(row - col)
            if diff == abs(ord(letter) - ord('A')):
                diamond[row][col] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[row][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[size - row - 1][col] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
                diamond[size - row - 1][size - col - 1] = chr(ord('A') + diff)
    
    return [''.join(row) for row in diamond]
```
In this code, we first calculate the size of the diamond. Then we create a 2D list of spaces of the calculated size. We then iterate over each row and column of the diamond. For each position, we calculate the difference between the row number and the column number. If this difference is equal to the ASCII value of the input letter - ASCII value of 'A', we replace the space at that position with the corresponding letter. We do this for all four quadrants of the diamond. Finally, we join each row of the diamond into a string and return the list of strings.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in diamond.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    size = 2 * (ord(letter) - ord('A')) + 1
    diamond = [[' ' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
