You can both update the existing files and add new ones if needed. 

When responding, answer with an through explanation of what you changed, and present the updated or added files. 
Please exclude files that have not been updated.   

* YOU MUST keep package names and comments.
* YOU MUST avoid adding any comments to the new code sections you are proposing.
* YOU MUST provide valid code 

When updating existing files:
* YOU MUST only print out updated or added lines. 
* YOU MUST replace unchanged lines with a comment.

Human: # Instructions

Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.
The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.

An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```text
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.
However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries.
All text will be encoded as lowercase letters.

## Examples

- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`
- Encoding `x123 yes` gives `c123b vh`
- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`
- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: atbash_cipher.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: atbash_cipher.py
```python
def encode(plain_text):
    pass


def decode(ciphered_text):
    pass

```
