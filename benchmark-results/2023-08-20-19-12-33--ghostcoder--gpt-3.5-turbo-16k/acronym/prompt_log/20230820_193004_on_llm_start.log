Human: # Instructions

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

Punctuation is handled as follows: hyphens are word separators (like whitespace); all other punctuation can be removed from the input.

For example:

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|As Soon As Possible|ASAP|
|Liquid-crystal display|LCD|
|Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: acronym.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: acronym.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: acronym.py
```python
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    # Remove all punctuation except hyphens
    words = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', words)
    
    # Split the words by whitespace and hyphens
    words = re.split(r'[\s-]+', words)
    
    # Get the first letter of each word and convert to uppercase
    acronym = [word[0].upper() for word in words]
    
    # Join the letters to form the acronym
    acronym = ''.join(acronym)
    
    return acronym
```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in acronym.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: acronym.py
```python
import re

def abbreviate(words):
    # Remove all punctuation except hyphens
    words = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', words)
    
    # Split the words by whitespace and hyphens
    words = re.split(r'[\s-]+', words)
    
    # Get the first letter of each word and convert to uppercase
    acronym = [word[0].upper() for word in words]
    
    # Join the letters to form the acronym
    acronym = ''.join(acronym)
    
    return acronym
```
