prompt:
I apologize for the mistake. I have reviewed the code and identified the issue. The problem lies in the calculation of the number of spaces before and after the letter. Currently, it is calculating the number of spaces based on the distance from the middle row, but it should be based on the distance from the middle column.

To fix this, I will update the calculation of `num_spaces` to be based on the distance from the middle column. Here's the updated code:

Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows in the diamond
    num_rows = (ord(letter) - ord('A')) * 2 + 1

    # Create an empty list to store the rows
    diamond = []

    # Iterate through each row
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Calculate the distance from the middle row
        distance_from_middle_row = abs(i - (num_rows // 2))

        # Calculate the distance from the middle column
        distance_from_middle_column = abs(distance_from_middle_row - (num_rows // 2))

        # Calculate the letter for the current row
        current_letter = chr(ord('A') + distance_from_middle_row)

        # Calculate the number of spaces before and after the letter
        num_spaces = num_rows // 2 - distance_from_middle_column

        # Create the row string with the appropriate number of spaces and letters
        row = ' ' * num_spaces + current_letter + ' ' * num_spaces

        # Add the row to the diamond list
        diamond.append(row)

    # Return the diamond as a list of rows
    return diamond
```

Explanation:
- I updated the calculation of `distance_from_middle_column` to be based on the distance from the middle row.
- I updated the calculation of `num_spaces` to be based on the distance from the middle column.
- The rest of the code remains the same.
