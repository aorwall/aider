Filepath: diamond.py
```python
def rows(letter):
    # Calculate the number of rows in the diamond
    num_rows = (ord(letter) - ord('A')) * 2 + 1

    # Create an empty list to store the rows
    diamond = []

    # Iterate through each row
    for i in range(num_rows):
        # Calculate the distance from the middle row
        distance = abs(i - (num_rows // 2))

        # Calculate the letter for the current row
        current_letter = chr(ord('A') + distance)

        # Calculate the number of spaces before and after the letter
        num_spaces = num_rows // 2 - distance

        # Create the row string with the appropriate number of spaces and letters
        row = ' ' * num_spaces + current_letter + ' ' * num_spaces

        # Add the row to the diamond list
        diamond.append(row)

    # Return the diamond as a list of rows
    return diamond
```

Explanation:
- I added code to calculate the number of rows in the diamond based on the input letter.
- I created an empty list to store the rows of the diamond.
- I iterated through each row and calculated the distance from the middle row.
- I calculated the letter for the current row based on the distance.
- I calculated the number of spaces before and after the letter.
- I created the row string with the appropriate number of spaces and letters.
- I added the row to the diamond list.
- I returned the diamond as a list of rows.
