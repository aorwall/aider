prompt:
I apologize for the mistake. I have reviewed the code and made the necessary corrections. Here is the updated code for the `recite` function in `bottle_song.py`:

```python
def recite(start, take=1):
    lyrics = []
    for i in range(start, start - take, -1):
        if i > 2:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
            lyrics.append(f"There'll be {i-1} green bottles hanging on the wall.")
        elif i == 2:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottles hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
            lyrics.append(f"There'll be {i-1} green bottle hanging on the wall.")
        elif i == 1:
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append(f"{i} green bottle hanging on the wall,")
            lyrics.append("And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,")
            lyrics.append("There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.")
    return lyrics
```

Explanation:
I have updated the code to handle the cases where the number of bottles is 2. Previously, it was treating it as a generic case for more than 2 bottles. Now, it correctly appends the lyrics for 2 bottles hanging on the wall and adjusts the subsequent lyrics accordingly.

Please try running the tests again, and they should pass this time.
