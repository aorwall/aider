I will start by implementing the `Board` class and its constructor. The constructor will initialize the `board` attribute with the provided board and create an empty dictionary to store the territories of each player. 

I will also implement the `territory` method, which will take a coordinate on the board and return the owner of that area and the set of coordinates representing the owner's territories. 

Finally, I will implement the `territories` method, which will find the owners and territories of the whole board and return them as a dictionary. 

Here's the updated code:

```python
class Board:
    """Count territories of each player in a Go game

    Args:
        board (list[str]): A two-dimensional Go board
    """

    def __init__(self, board):
        self.board = board
        self.territories_dict = {}

    def territory(self, x, y):
        """Find the owner and the territories given a coordinate on
           the board

        Args:
            x (int): Column on the board
            y (int): Row on the board

        Returns:
            (str, set): A tuple, the first element being the owner
                        of that area.  One of "W", "B", "".  The
                        second being a set of coordinates, representing
                        the owner's territories.
        """
        if not (0 <= x < len(self.board[0]) and 0 <= y < len(self.board)):
            raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')

        if (x, y) in self.territories_dict:
            return self.territories_dict[(x, y)]

        owner = self.board[y][x]
        territories = set()
        visited = set()

        def dfs(x, y):
            if (x, y) in visited:
                return
            visited.add((x, y))

            if not (0 <= x < len(self.board[0]) and 0 <= y < len(self.board)):
                return

            if self.board[y][x] == owner:
                territories.add((x, y))
                dfs(x + 1, y)
                dfs(x - 1, y)
                dfs(x, y + 1)
                dfs(x, y - 1)

        dfs(x, y)
        self.territories_dict[(x, y)] = (owner, territories)
        return (owner, territories)

    def territories(self):
        """Find the owners and the territories of the whole board

        Args:
            none

        Returns:
            dict(str, set): A dictionary whose key being the owner
                        , i.e. "W", "B", "".  The value being a set
                        of coordinates owned by the owner.
        """
        territories_dict = {}

        for y in range(len(self.board)):
            for x in range(len(self.board[0])):
                if (x, y) not in self.territories_dict:
                    owner, territories = self.territory(x, y)
                    if owner in territories_dict:
                        territories_dict[owner] |= territories
                    else:
                        territories_dict[owner] = territories

        return territories_dict
```

I have added the `self.board` attribute to store the provided board and the `self.territories_dict` attribute to store the territories of each player. 

In the `territory` method, I added a check to validate the coordinates and raise a `ValueError` if they are invalid. 

I implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the owner and territories of a given coordinate. The DFS function is defined inside the `territory` method to keep track of the visited coordinates and avoid infinite recursion. 

In the `territories` method, I iterate over all coordinates on the board and call the `territory` method for each coordinate that has not been visited yet. I update the `territories_dict` with the territories of each player. 

Now the `Board` class should be able to count the territories of each player.
