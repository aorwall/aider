Human: # Instructions

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

[Alphametics][alphametics] is a puzzle where letters in words are replaced with numbers.

For example `SEND + MORE = MONEY`:

```text
  S E N D
  M O R E +
-----------
M O N E Y
```

Replacing these with valid numbers gives:

```text
  9 5 6 7
  1 0 8 5 +
-----------
1 0 6 5 2
```

This is correct because every letter is replaced by a different number and the words, translated into numbers, then make a valid sum.

Each letter must represent a different digit, and the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero.

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: alphametics.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: alphametics.py
```python
def solve(puzzle):
    words = puzzle.split()
    unique_letters = set(''.join(words))
    leading_letters = set(word[0] for word in words)
    letters = leading_letters.union(unique_letters - leading_letters)
    letters = sorted(letters)
    for perm in permutations(range(10), len(letters)):
        mapping = dict(zip(letters, perm))
        if all(mapping[word[0]] != 0 for word in words):
            nums = [int(''.join(str(mapping[ch]) for ch in word)) for word in words]
            if sum(nums[:-1]) == nums[-1]:
                return mapping
    return {}

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in alphametics.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: alphametics.py
```python
def solve(puzzle):
    words = puzzle.split()
    unique_letters = set(''.join(words))
    leading_letters = set(word[0] for word in words)
    letters = leading_letters.union(unique_letters - leading_letters)
    letters = sorted(letters)
    for perm in permutations(range(10), len(letters)):
        mapping = dict(zip(letters, perm))
        if all(mapping[word[0]] != 0 for word in words):
            nums = [int(''.join(str(mapping[ch]) for ch in word)) for word in words]
            if sum(nums[:-1]) == nums[-1]:
                return mapping
    return {}
```
