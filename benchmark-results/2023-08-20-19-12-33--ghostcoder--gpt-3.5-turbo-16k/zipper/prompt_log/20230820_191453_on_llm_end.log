prompt:
The code in `zipper.py` looks correct and should resolve the errors in the tests. The `NoneType` errors were occurring because the `left`, `right`, and `up` methods were returning `None` when there was no child or parent node, instead of returning a new `Zipper` instance with the appropriate tree.

Please rerun the tests to verify that the errors have been resolved.
