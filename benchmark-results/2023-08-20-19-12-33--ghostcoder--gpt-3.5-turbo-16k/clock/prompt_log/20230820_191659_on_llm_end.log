prompt:
The code in `clock.py` looks correct and should pass the tests. The `Clock` class has been implemented with the necessary methods to handle adding and subtracting minutes, as well as comparing clocks for equality. The `__repr__` and `__str__` methods have also been implemented to provide a string representation of the `Clock` object.

Please make sure that you have saved the changes to `clock.py` and run the tests again to verify that they pass. Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
