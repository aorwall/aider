I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the test cases are expecting additional methods that are not implemented in the code. To resolve the errors, I will add the missing methods to the `HighScores` class.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: high_scores.py
```python
class HighScores:
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def highest(self):
        highest_score = max(self.scores)
        return highest_score

    def last_added(self):
        last_score = self.scores[-1]
        return last_score

    def top_three(self):
        sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)
        top_three_scores = sorted_scores[:3]
        return top_three_scores

    def personal_best(self):
        return self.highest()

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return self.top_three()

    def latest(self):
        return self.last_added()
```

Explanation:
- Added the `personal_best` method, which simply calls the `highest` method to return the personal best score.
- Added the `personal_top_three` method, which simply calls the `top_three` method to return the personal top three scores.
- Added the `latest` method, which simply calls the `last_added` method to return the latest score.
