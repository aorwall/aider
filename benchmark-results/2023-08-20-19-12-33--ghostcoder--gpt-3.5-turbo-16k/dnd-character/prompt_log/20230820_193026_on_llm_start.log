Human: # Instructions

For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.
These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.
You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.
You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.
You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:

- 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
- 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
- 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
- 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
- 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
- 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.

Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

## Notes

Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.
One such language is [Troll][troll].

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: dnd_character.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability()
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.get_modifier(self.constitution)

    def roll_ability(self):
        dice_rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        dice_rolls.sort()
        return sum(dice_rolls[1:])

    def get_modifier(self, ability_score):
        return (ability_score - 10) // 2
```
Explanation:
- I imported the `random` module to generate random numbers for rolling the dice.
- In the `Character` class, I added the initialization of the character's abilities (`strength`, `dexterity`, `constitution`, `intelligence`, `wisdom`, `charisma`) by calling the `roll_ability` method.
- I also added the calculation of the character's hitpoints by calling the `get_modifier` method to calculate the constitution modifier and adding it to 10.
- I implemented the `roll_ability` method to generate four random dice rolls, sort them in ascending order, and sum the largest three dice rolls.
- I implemented the `get_modifier` method to calculate the ability score modifier by subtracting 10 from the ability score and dividing the result by 2, rounding down.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in dnd_character.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: dnd_character.py
```python
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_ability()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_ability()
        self.constitution = self.roll_ability()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_ability()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_ability()
        self.charisma = self.roll_ability()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + self.get_modifier(self.constitution)

    def roll_ability(self):
        dice_rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        dice_rolls.sort()
        return sum(dice_rolls[1:])

    def get_modifier(self, ability_score):
        return (ability_score - 10) // 2
```
