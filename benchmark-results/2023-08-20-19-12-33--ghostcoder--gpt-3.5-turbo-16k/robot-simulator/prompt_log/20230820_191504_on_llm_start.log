Human: # Instructions

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.
  Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

####

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: robot_simulator.py
```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = None
NORTH = None
WEST = None
SOUTH = None


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        pass

```
