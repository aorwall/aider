I apologize for the oversight. It seems that the Robot class in the robot_simulator.py file is missing the move method, which is causing the test errors. 

To resolve the errors, I will add the move method to the Robot class. The move method will take a string of instructions and execute each instruction one by one.

Here is the updated code for the robot_simulator.py file:

```python
# Globals for the directions
# Change the values as you see fit
EAST = 'EAST'
NORTH = 'NORTH'
WEST = 'WEST'
SOUTH = 'SOUTH'


class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    def turn_right(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def turn_left(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.direction = WEST
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.direction = SOUTH
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.direction = EAST
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.direction = NORTH

    def advance(self):
        if self.direction == NORTH:
            self.y_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == EAST:
            self.x_pos += 1
        elif self.direction == SOUTH:
            self.y_pos -= 1
        elif self.direction == WEST:
            self.x_pos -= 1

    def move(self, instructions):
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'R':
                self.turn_right()
            elif instruction == 'L':
                self.turn_left()
            elif instruction == 'A':
                self.advance()
```

With this update, the Robot class now has a move method that takes a string of instructions and executes them accordingly. This should resolve the test errors.
