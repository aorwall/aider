```python
import math

def score(x, y):
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    if distance > 10:
        return 0
    elif distance > 5:
        return 1
    elif distance > 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10
```

Explanation:
- I imported the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function for calculating the distance.
- I calculated the distance of the point `(x, y)` from the origin `(0, 0)` using the formula `distance = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`.
- I used if-elif-else statements to determine the earned points based on the distance:
  - If the distance is greater than 10, the dart lands outside the target and earns 0 points.
  - If the distance is greater than 5, the dart lands in the outer circle and earns 1 point.
  - If the distance is greater than 1, the dart lands in the middle circle and earns 5 points.
  - If the distance is 1 or less, the dart lands in the inner circle and earns 10 points.
- I returned the earned points based on the conditions.
