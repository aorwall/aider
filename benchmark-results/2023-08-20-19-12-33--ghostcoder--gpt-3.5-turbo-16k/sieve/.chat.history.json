Find the next unmarked number in your list. This is a prime number.\n2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as composite (not prime).\n\nYou keep repeating these steps until you've gone through every number in your list.\nAt the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\n[Wikipedia's Sieve of Eratosthenes article][eratosthenes] has a useful graphic that explains the algorithm.\n\nThe tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct list of primes.\nA good first test is to check that you do not use division or remainder operations.\n\n[eratosthenes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\n~~~~\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sieve.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
