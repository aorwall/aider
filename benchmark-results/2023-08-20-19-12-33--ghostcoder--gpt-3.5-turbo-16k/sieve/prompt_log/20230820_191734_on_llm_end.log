    else:
        primes_list = [True] * (limit + 1)
        primes_list[0] = primes_list[1] = False

        for i in range(2, int(limit ** 0.5) + 1):
            if primes_list[i]:
                for j in range(i * i, limit + 1, i):
                    primes_list[j] = False

        return [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(primes_list) if is_prime]

Explanation:
- I added an implementation to the `primes` function that follows the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- I created a list `primes_list` of booleans, where `primes_list[i]` represents whether `i` is prime or not.
- I initialized all elements of `primes_list` to `True`, except for the first two elements which are set to `False` since 0 and 1 are not prime.
- I iterated from 2 to the square root of the limit (inclusive) and checked if the current number is prime.
- If the current number is prime, I marked all its multiples as composite by setting their corresponding elements in `primes_list` to `False`.
- Finally, I returned a list of all the indices where `primes_list` is `True`, which represents the prime numbers up to the given limit.
