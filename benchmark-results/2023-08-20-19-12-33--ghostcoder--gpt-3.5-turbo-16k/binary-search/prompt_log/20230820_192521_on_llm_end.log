I will implement the binary search algorithm in the `find` function in the `binary_search.py` file. 

To do this, I will use a while loop to repeatedly split the list in half until the value is found or all possible locations have been eliminated. I will keep track of the start and end indices of the sublist that we are currently searching. 

In each iteration of the loop, I will calculate the middle index of the sublist and compare the value at that index with the target value. If they are equal, I will return the index. If the value at the middle index is greater than the target value, I will update the end index to be one less than the middle index. If the value at the middle index is less than the target value, I will update the start index to be one more than the middle index. 

If the start index becomes greater than the end index, it means that the target value is not in the list, so I will raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message. 

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: binary_search.py
```python
def find(search_list, value):
    start = 0
    end = len(search_list) - 1

    while start <= end:
        middle = (start + end) // 2
        if search_list[middle] == value:
            return middle
        elif search_list[middle] > value:
            end = middle - 1
        else:
            start = middle + 1

    raise ValueError("Value not found in list")
```

I have implemented the binary search algorithm in the `find` function. The function takes a sorted list and a value as input and returns the index of the value in the list if it is found. If the value is not found, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
