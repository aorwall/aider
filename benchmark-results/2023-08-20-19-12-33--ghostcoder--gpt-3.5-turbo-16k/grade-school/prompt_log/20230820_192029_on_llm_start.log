Human: # Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think.
    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.
    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
# Instructions append

The tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade_school.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Explanation:
- Added an instance variable `students` to the `School` class to store the students' names and grades.
- In the `add_student` method, if the grade already exists in the `students` dictionary, the student's name is appended to the list of names for that grade. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the `students` dictionary with the grade as the key and a list containing the student's name as the value.
- In the `roster` method, the students' names are sorted by grade and then alphabetically within each grade. The sorted names are stored in the `sorted_students` list and returned.
- In the `grade` method, if the grade exists in the `students` dictionary, the names for that grade are sorted and returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.
- In the `added` method, the `students` dictionary is returned as is.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in grade_school.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: grade_school.py
```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade):
        if grade in self.students:
            self.students[grade].append(name)
        else:
            self.students[grade] = [name]

    def roster(self):

        for grade in sorted(self.students.keys()):
            sorted_students.extend(sorted(self.students[grade]))
        return sorted_students
