Filepath: anagram.py
```python
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    anagrams = []
    for candidate in candidates:
        if sorted(word.lower()) == sorted(candidate.lower()) and word.lower() != candidate.lower():
            anagrams.append(candidate)
    return anagrams
```
Explanation: 
- I added a loop to iterate through each candidate word in the list of candidates.
- I used the `sorted()` function to sort the letters of both the target word and the candidate word in alphabetical order.
- I used the `lower()` method to convert both the target word and the candidate word to lowercase, so that the comparison is case-insensitive.
- I added a condition to check if the sorted target word is equal to the sorted candidate word, and also check if the target word is not equal to the candidate word (to exclude the target word itself).
- If the condition is satisfied, I appended the candidate word to the `anagrams` list.
- Finally, I returned the `anagrams` list.
