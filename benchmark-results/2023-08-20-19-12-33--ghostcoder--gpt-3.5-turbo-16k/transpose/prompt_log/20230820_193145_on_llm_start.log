Human: # Instructions

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows.
See [transpose][].

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

Filepath: transpose.py
AI: I updated a file.
Filepath: transpose.py
```python
def transpose(lines):
    # Get the maximum length of any line in the input
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)

    # Pad each line with spaces to make them all the same length
    padded_lines = [line.ljust(max_length) for line in lines]

    # Transpose the lines by swapping rows and columns
    transposed_lines = [''.join(row) for row in zip(*padded_lines)]

    return transposed_lines
```

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in transpose.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: transpose.py
```python
def transpose(lines):
    # Get the maximum length of any line in the input
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)

    # Pad each line with spaces to make them all the same length
    padded_lines = [line.ljust(max_length) for line in lines]

    # Transpose the lines by swapping rows and columns
    transposed_lines = [''.join(row) for row in zip(*padded_lines)]

    return transposed_lines
```
