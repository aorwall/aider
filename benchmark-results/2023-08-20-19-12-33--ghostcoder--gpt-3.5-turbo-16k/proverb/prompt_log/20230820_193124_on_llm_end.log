I apologize for the mistake. The issue is that the `proverb` function is expecting the `qualifier` argument as a positional argument, but the test cases are passing it as a keyword argument. To fix this, we can modify the function signature to accept `qualifier` as a keyword argument with a default value of `None`. This way, the function can be called with or without the `qualifier` argument.

Here's the updated code:

Filepath: proverb.py
```python
def proverb(*words, qualifier=None):
    lines = []
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        lines.append(f"For want of a {words[i]} the {words[i+1]} was lost.")
    if words:
        lines.append(f"And all for the want of a {qualifier} {words[0]}.")
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

Now the function can be called with or without the `qualifier` argument, and the tests should pass.
