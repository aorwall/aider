When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the question contains an unknown operation.\nraise ValueError(\"unknown operation\")\n\n# if the question is malformed or invalid.\nraise ValueError(\"syntax error\")\n```\n\n####\n\nUse the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py\nKeep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.\nOnly use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.\n",
