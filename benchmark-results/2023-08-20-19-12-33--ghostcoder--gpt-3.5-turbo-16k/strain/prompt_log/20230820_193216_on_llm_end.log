def keep(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if predicate(item)]


def discard(sequence, predicate):
    return [item for item in sequence if not predicate(item)]
```

Explanation:
I have implemented the `keep` and `discard` functions using list comprehension. The `keep` function filters the elements of the sequence based on the predicate and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate is true. The `discard` function does the opposite, it filters the elements based on the predicate and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate is false.
