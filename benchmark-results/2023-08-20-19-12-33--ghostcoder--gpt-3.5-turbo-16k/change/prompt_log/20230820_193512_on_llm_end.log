I updated the code in `change.py` to fix the errors. 

Here are the changes I made:

1. Added a check to ensure that the target value is not negative. If it is negative, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Target cannot be negative".
2. Added a check to ensure that the target value is not smaller than the smallest coin value. If it is smaller, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Target value is smaller than the smallest coin value".
3. Removed the unnecessary check for target being equal to 0, as it is already handled in the loop.
4. Changed the error message in the `ValueError` raised when the target cannot be made with the given coins to "Cannot make target with given coins".

Here is the updated code:

Filepath: change.py
```python
def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    if target < 0:
        raise ValueError("Target cannot be negative")
    if target < min(coins):
        raise ValueError("Target value is smaller than the smallest coin value")
    
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    result = []
    for coin in coins:
        while target >= coin:
            target -= coin
            result.append(coin)
    if target != 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot make target with given coins")
    return result
```
