Human: # Instructions

Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.
It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.

- **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
  Please note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay").
- **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
  Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, such as the "ch" in "chair" or "st" in "stand" (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").
- **Rule 3**: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay").
- **Rule 4**: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word it makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").

There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.
Check the tests for all the details.

Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig_latin.py
Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.
Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

See the testing errors above.
The tests are correct.
Fix the code in pig_latin.py to resolve the errors.

Filepath: pig_latin.py
```python
def translate(text):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        if word[0] in vowels or word[:2] in ['xr', 'yt']:
            pig_latin_words.append(word + 'ay')
        elif word[:2] == 'qu':
            pig_latin_words.append(word[2:] + 'quay')
        else:
            consonant_cluster = ''
            i = 0
            while i < len(word) and word[i] not in vowels:
                if i < len(word) - 1 and word[i] == 'y' and word[i+1] not in vowels:
                    break
                consonant_cluster += word[i]
                i += 1
            pig_latin_words.append(word[i:] + consonant_cluster + 'ay')
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```
