#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Reparent a tree on a selected node.  
####   
#### A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.  
#### That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.  
####   
#### This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.  
#### For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     +------0------+  
####     |      |      |  
####   +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+  
####   |   |  |   |  |   |  
####   4   5  6   7  8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### But there is no inherent direction in a tree.  
#### The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.  
#### So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:  
####   
#### ```text  
####         6  
####         |  
####   +-----2-----+  
####   |           |  
####   7     +-----0-----+  
####         |           |  
####       +-1-+       +-3-+  
####       |   |       |   |  
####       4   5       8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.  
#### So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.  
####   
#### This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

#### [wiki-tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV  
#### raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")  
####   
#### #when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.  
#### raise ValueError("No path found")  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `from_pov` and `path_to` methods in the `Tree` class, we need to modify the `pov.py` file. 

The `from_pov` method should reorient the tree from the perspective of the given node. This involves finding the node in the tree, then changing the parent-child relationships along the path from the root to the node. 

The `path_to` method should return the path from one node to another in the reoriented tree. This involves traversing the tree from the start node to the end node and recording the path.

Here are the steps to implement these methods:

1. In the `from_pov` method, first check if the current node is the one we're looking for. If it is, return the current tree because it's already oriented from the correct point of view. If it's not, recursively call `from_pov` on each child of the current node. If the node is found in a child's subtree, remove that child from the current node's children, add the current node to the child's children, and return the child. If the node is not found in any child's subtree, return the current tree.

2. In the `path_to` method, first check if the start node is the same as the end node. If it is, return a list containing just the start node. If it's not, recursively call `path_to` on each child of the start node. If the end node is found in a child's subtree, prepend the start node to the path and return it. If the end node is not found in any child's subtree, raise a `ValueError`.

Here are the changes to the `pov.py` file:

```python
pov.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        pass

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        pass
=======
    def from_pov(self, from_node):
        if self.label == from_node:
            return self
        for child in self.children:
            try:
                new_root = child.from_pov(from_node)
            except ValueError:
                continue
            else:
                self.children.remove(child)
                child.children.append(self)
                return new_root
        raise ValueError("Tree could not be reoriented")

    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):
        if self.label == from_node:
            if from_node == to_node:
                return [from_node]
            else:
                for child in self.children:
                    try:
                        path = child.path_to(child.label, to_node)
                    except ValueError:
                        continue
                    else:
                        return [from_node] + path
        raise ValueError("No path found")
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes should allow the `Tree` class to reorient itself from the point of view of any node and find the path between any two nodes.

The errors indicate that the `path_to` method in the `pov.py` file is not able to find a path between two nodes in certain scenarios. This could be due to the fact that the current implementation of the `path_to` method only looks for paths in the children of the current node. If the `to_node` is not a child of the `from_node`, the method will not be able to find a path.

To fix this, we need to modify the `path_to` method to search for paths not only in the children of the current node, but also in the parent and siblings of the current node. This can be achieved by adding a `parent` attribute to each node, which will allow us to traverse up the tree, and by adding a method to find a node in the tree, which will allow us to start the path search from any node, not just the root.

Here are the steps to implement these changes:

1. Add a `parent` attribute to the `Tree` class and update the `from_pov` method to set this attribute when reorienting the tree.
2. Add a `find` method to the `Tree` class to find a node in the tree.
3. Update the `path_to` method to start the path search from the `from_node` and to search for paths in the parent and siblings of the current node.

Here are the proposed changes:

The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in pov.py with nothing missing!

I apologize for the confusion. I see that I made a mistake in the HEAD section of the edit block. I included too many lines. Let's correct this.

We need to modify the `__init__`, `from_pov`, and `path_to` methods in the `Tree` class. Let's create separate edit blocks for each method.

Here are the corrected edit blocks:
