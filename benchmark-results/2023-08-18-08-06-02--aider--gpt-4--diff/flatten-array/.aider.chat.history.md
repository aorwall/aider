#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.  
####   
#### The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]  
####   
#### output: [1,2,3,4,5]  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: flatten_array.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the flatten function, we will use recursion. The function will iterate over each element in the input list. If the element is a list, the function will call itself with this list as the argument. If the element is not a list and is not None, the function will append the element to the result list.

Here is the change to make:

```python
flatten_array.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def flatten(iterable):
    pass
=======
def flatten(iterable):
    result = []
    for element in iterable:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            result.extend(flatten(element))
        elif element is not None:
            result.append(element)
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```

> Applied edit to flatten_array.py
