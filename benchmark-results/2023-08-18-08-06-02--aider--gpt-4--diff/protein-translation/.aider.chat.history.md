#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Translate RNA sequences into proteins.  
####   
#### RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCU"` => translates to  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU"`  
#### => which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  
#### If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.  
#### However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.  
####   
#### There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.  
####   
#### All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG"` =>  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAA", "AUG"` =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### Note the stop codon `"UAA"` terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.  
####   
#### Below are the codons and resulting Amino Acids needed for the exercise.  
####   
#### Codon                 | Protein  
#### :---                  | :---  
#### AUG                   | Methionine  
#### UUU, UUC              | Phenylalanine  
#### UUA, UUG              | Leucine  
#### UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG    | Serine  
#### UAU, UAC              | Tyrosine  
#### UGU, UGC              | Cysteine  
#### UGG                   | Tryptophan  
#### UAA, UAG, UGA         | STOP

To implement the protein translation, we need to map the codons to their corresponding proteins. We can use a dictionary for this purpose. Then, we will break the input RNA sequence into codons and translate each codon into a protein until we encounter a 'STOP' codon.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Create a dictionary to map codons to proteins.
2. In the `proteins` function, initialize an empty list to store the proteins.
3. Break the input RNA sequence into codons.
4. For each codon, check if it is a 'STOP' codon. If it is, break the loop. Otherwise, translate the codon into a protein and add it to the list.
5. Return the list of proteins.

Here is the code change:

```python
protein_translation.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def proteins(strand):
    pass
=======
CODON_PROTEIN = {
    'AUG': 'Methionine',
    'UUU': 'Phenylalanine',
    'UUC': 'Phenylalanine',
    'UUA': 'Leucine',
    'UUG': 'Leucine',
    'UCU': 'Serine',
    'UCC': 'Serine',
    'UCA': 'Serine',
    'UCG': 'Serine',
    'UAU': 'Tyrosine',
    'UAC': 'Tyrosine',
    'UGU': 'Cysteine',
    'UGC': 'Cysteine',
    'UGG': 'Tryptophan',
    'UAA': 'STOP',
    'UAG': 'STOP',
    'UGA': 'STOP',
}

def proteins(strand):
    proteins = []
    for i in range(0, len(strand), 3):
        codon = strand[i:i+3]
        protein = CODON_PROTEIN[codon]
        if protein == 'STOP':
            break
        proteins.append(protein)
    return proteins
