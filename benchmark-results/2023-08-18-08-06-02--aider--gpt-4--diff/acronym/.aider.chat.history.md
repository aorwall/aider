#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a phrase to its acronym.  
####   
#### Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!  
####   
#### Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).  
####   
#### Punctuation is handled as follows: hyphens are word separators (like whitespace); all other punctuation can be removed from the input.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### |Input|Output|  
#### |-|-|  
#### |As Soon As Possible|ASAP|  
#### |Liquid-crystal display|LCD|  
#### |Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: acronym.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the acronym generator, we need to modify the `abbreviate` function in the `acronym.py` file. 

The steps to implement this function are as follows:

1. Split the input string into words. We consider both spaces and hyphens as word separators.
2. For each word, take the first character, convert it to uppercase and append it to the acronym.
3. Return the acronym.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
acronym.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def abbreviate(words):
    pass
=======
def abbreviate(words):
    words = words.replace('-', ' ').split()
    acronym = ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in words)
    return acronym
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code replaces all hyphens with spaces, splits the string into words, takes the first character of each word, converts it to uppercase, and joins them together to form the acronym.

The test is failing because the current implementation considers underscores as part of the word, which is not correct according to the problem statement. We need to treat underscores as non-word characters and remove them from the input.

To fix this, we need to modify the `abbreviate` function in the `acronym.py` file to remove underscores from the input string.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
acronym.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def abbreviate(words):
    words = words.replace('-', ' ').split()
    acronym = ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in words)
    return acronym
=======
def abbreviate(words):
    words = words.replace('-', ' ').replace('_', ' ').split()
    acronym = ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in words)
    return acronym
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code replaces all hyphens and underscores with spaces, splits the string into words, takes the first character of each word, converts it to uppercase, and joins them together to form the acronym.
