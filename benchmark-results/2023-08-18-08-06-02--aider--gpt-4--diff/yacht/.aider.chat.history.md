#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The dice game [Yacht][yacht] is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.  
#### In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered in any of twelve categories.  
#### The score of a throw of the dice depends on category chosen.  
####   
#### ## Scores in Yacht  
####   
#### | Category | Score | Description | Example |  
#### | -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |  
#### | Ones | 1 × number of ones | Any combination | 1 1 1 4 5 scores 3 |  
#### | Twos | 2 × number of twos | Any combination | 2 2 3 4 5 scores 4 |  
#### | Threes | 3 × number of threes | Any combination | 3 3 3 3 3 scores 15 |  
#### | Fours | 4 × number of fours | Any combination | 1 2 3 3 5 scores 0 |  
#### | Fives | 5 × number of fives| Any combination | 5 1 5 2 5 scores 15 |  
#### | Sixes | 6 × number of sixes | Any combination | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 6 |  
#### | Full House | Total of the dice | Three of one number and two of another | 3 3 3 5 5 scores 19 |  
#### | Four of a Kind | Total of the four dice | At least four dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 6 scores 16 |  
#### | Little Straight |  30 points | 1-2-3-4-5 | 1 2 3 4 5 scores 30 |  
#### | Big Straight | 30 points | 2-3-4-5-6 | 2 3 4 5 6 scores 30 |  
#### | Choice | Sum of the dice | Any combination | 2 3 3 4 6 scores 18 |  
#### | Yacht | 50 points | All five dice showing the same face | 4 4 4 4 4 scores 50 |  
####   
#### If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of a category, the score is zero.  
#### If, for example, *Four Of A Kind* is entered in the *Yacht* category, zero points are scored.  
#### A *Yacht* scores zero if entered in the *Full House* category.  
####   
#### ## Task  
####   
#### Given a list of values for five dice and a category, your solution should return the score of the dice for that category.  
#### If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of the category your solution should return 0.  
#### You can assume that five values will always be presented, and the value of each will be between one and six inclusively.  
#### You should not assume that the dice are ordered.

To implement the Yacht game scoring system, we need to modify the `yacht.py` file. We will assign the categories to their respective scoring functions and implement the `score` function to calculate the score based on the category and dice values.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Assign the categories to their respective scoring functions. For example, `ONES` will be assigned to a function that calculates the score for the "Ones" category.
2. Implement the `score` function. This function will take the dice values and the category as input and return the score for that category.

Here are the changes we need to make:

```python
yacht.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Score categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
YACHT = None
ONES = None
TWOS = None
THREES = None
FOURS = None
FIVES = None
SIXES = None
FULL_HOUSE = None
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = None
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = None
BIG_STRAIGHT = None
CHOICE = None

def score(dice, category):
    pass
=======
# Score categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
YACHT = lambda dice: 50 if len(set(dice)) == 1 else 0
ONES = lambda dice: dice.count(1)
TWOS = lambda dice: dice.count(2) * 2
THREES = lambda dice: dice.count(3) * 3
FOURS = lambda dice: dice.count(4) * 4
FIVES = lambda dice: dice.count(5) * 5
SIXES = lambda dice: dice.count(6) * 6
FULL_HOUSE = lambda dice: sum(dice) if sorted([dice.count(i) for i in set(dice)]) == [2, 3] else 0
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = lambda dice: sorted(dice)[-1] * 4 if dice.count(sorted(dice)[-1]) >= 4 else 0
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = lambda dice: 30 if sorted(dice) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] else 0
BIG_STRAIGHT = lambda dice: 30 if sorted(dice) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] else 0
CHOICE = sum

def score(dice, category):
    return category(dice)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code assigns each category to a lambda function that calculates the score for that category. The `score` function then simply calls the category function with the dice values to calculate the score.

yacht.py does not contain the *exact sequence* of HEAD lines you specified.
Try again.
DO NOT skip blank lines, comments, docstrings, etc!
The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in yacht.py with nothing missing!

yacht.py does not contain these 17 exact lines in a row:
```
# Score categories.
# Change the values as you see fit.
YACHT = None
ONES = None
TWOS = None
THREES = None
FOURS = None
FIVES = None
SIXES = None
FULL_HOUSE = None
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = None
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = None
BIG_STRAIGHT = None
CHOICE = None

def score(dice, category):
    pass
```  
> 2219 prompt tokens, 447 completion tokens, $0.093390 cost  

I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the edit block. I should have split the changes into two separate edit blocks: one for the category assignments and another for the `score` function. Let's correct this.

Here are the corrected changes:

```python
yacht.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
YACHT = None
ONES = None
TWOS = None
THREES = None
FOURS = None
FIVES = None
SIXES = None
FULL_HOUSE = None
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = None
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = None
BIG_STRAIGHT = None
CHOICE = None
=======
YACHT = lambda dice: 50 if len(set(dice)) == 1 else 0
ONES = lambda dice: dice.count(1)
TWOS = lambda dice: dice.count(2) * 2
THREES = lambda dice: dice.count(3) * 3
FOURS = lambda dice: dice.count(4) * 4
FIVES = lambda dice: dice.count(5) * 5
SIXES = lambda dice: dice.count(6) * 6
FULL_HOUSE = lambda dice: sum(dice) if sorted([dice.count(i) for i in set(dice)]) == [2, 3] else 0
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = lambda dice: sorted(dice)[-1] * 4 if dice.count(sorted(dice)[-1]) >= 4 else 0
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = lambda dice: 30 if sorted(dice) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] else 0
BIG_STRAIGHT = lambda dice: 30 if sorted(dice) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] else 0
CHOICE = sum
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
yacht.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def score(dice, category):
    pass
=======
def score(dice, category):
    return category(dice)
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes should correctly implement the Yacht game scoring system.
