#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement encoding and decoding for the rail fence cipher.  
####   
#### The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded.  
#### It was already used by the ancient Greeks.  
####   
#### In the Rail Fence cipher, the message is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom (like a zig-zag).  
#### Finally the message is then read off in rows.  
####   
#### For example, using three "rails" and the message "WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE", the cipherer writes out:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then reads off:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN  
#### ```  
####   
#### To decrypt a message you take the zig-zag shape and fill the ciphertext along the rows.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ?  
#### . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### The first row has seven spots that can be filled with "WECRLTE".  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? . ? .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Now the 2nd row takes "ERDSOEEFEAOC".  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . . . ? . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### Leaving "AIVDEN" for the last row.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E  
#### . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .  
#### . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .  
#### ```  
####   
#### If you now read along the zig-zag shape you can read the original message.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rail_fence_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Rail Fence Cipher, we need to modify the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `rail_fence_cipher.py` file.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. For the `encode` function:
   - Create a list of empty strings for each rail.
   - Iterate over the characters in the message.
   - Add each character to the appropriate rail by calculating the rail index based on the current character index and the number of rails.
   - Concatenate all the rails to get the encoded message.

2. For the `decode` function:
   - Calculate the length of each rail based on the length of the encoded message and the number of rails.
   - Split the encoded message into rails.
   - Iterate over the indices of the encoded message.
   - Add each character to the decoded message by calculating the rail index based on the current index and the number of rails.

Here are the changes we need to make:

```python
rail_fence_cipher.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def encode(message, rails):
    pass


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    pass
=======
def encode(message, rails):
    fence = [[] for _ in range(rails)]
    rail = 0
    direction = 1

    for char in message:
        fence[rail].append(char)
        if rail == 0:
            direction = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            direction = -1
        rail += direction

    return ''.join([''.join(rail) for rail in fence])


def decode(encoded_message, rails):
    fence = [[] for _ in range(rails)]
    rail_lengths = [0] * rails
    rail = 0
    direction = 1

    for _ in encoded_message:
        rail_lengths[rail] += 1
        if rail == 0:
            direction = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            direction = -1
        rail += direction

    i = 0
    for rail in range(rails):
        for _ in range(rail_lengths[rail]):
            fence[rail].append(encoded_message[i])
            i += 1

    result = []
    rail = 0
    direction = 1

    for _ in encoded_message:
        result.append(fence[rail].pop(0))
        if rail == 0:
            direction = 1
        elif rail == rails - 1:
            direction = -1
        rail += direction

    return ''.join(result)
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes implement the Rail Fence Cipher encoding and decoding as described in the instructions.
