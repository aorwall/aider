To make the function `hello()` return the string "Hello, World!", we need to modify the `hello_world.py` file.

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

```python
hello_world.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def hello():
    return 'Goodbye, Mars!'
=======
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will make the function `hello()` return the string "Hello, World!" as required.

> Applied edit to hello_world.py
