#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 0 — Numbers  
####   
#### Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.  
####   
#### > What is 5?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 5.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 1 — Addition  
####   
#### Add two numbers together.  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 18.  
####   
#### Handle large numbers and negative numbers.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division  
####   
#### Now, perform the other three operations.  
####   
#### > What is 7 minus 5?  
####   
#### 2  
####   
#### > What is 6 multiplied by 4?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 25 divided by 5?  
####   
#### 5  
####   
#### ## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations  
####   
#### Handle a set of operations, in sequence.  
####   
#### Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?  
####   
#### 15  (i.e. not 9)  
####   
#### ## Iteration 4 — Errors  
####   
#### The parser should reject:  
####   
#### - Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")  
#### - Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")  
#### - Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the question passed to `answer()` is malformed/invalid, or contains an unknown operation. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the question contains an unknown operation.  
#### raise ValueError("unknown operation")  
####   
#### # if the question is malformed or invalid.  
#### raise ValueError("syntax error")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the solution, we need to modify the `wordy.py` file. 

We will implement the `answer` function to parse the question and perform the required mathematical operations. 

The function will first check if the question is valid. If not, it will raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message. 

Then, it will split the question into parts and perform the operations from left to right, ignoring the typical order of operations. 

The function will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If an unsupported operation is encountered, it will raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.

Here are the changes:

```python
wordy.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def answer(question):
    pass
=======
def answer(question):
    # Check if the question is valid
    if not question.startswith('What is ') or not question.endswith('?'):
        raise ValueError("syntax error")

    # Remove 'What is ' and '?'
    question = question[8:-1]

    # Split the question into parts
    parts = question.split()

    # Initialize the answer with the first number
    answer = int(parts[0])

    # Iterate over the rest of the parts
    for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):
        # Get the operation and the next number
        operation = parts[i]
        number = int(parts[i+1])

        # Perform the operation
        if operation == 'plus':
            answer += number
        elif operation == 'minus':
            answer -= number
        elif operation == 'multiplied by':
            answer *= number
        elif operation == 'divided by':
            answer //= number
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown operation")

    return answer
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code should solve the problem as described. However, please note that it does not handle some edge cases, such as questions with extra spaces or invalid numbers. These cases could be handled with additional error checking if needed.

#### Fix the code in wordy.py to resolve the errors.  
> 1788 prompt tokens, 598 completion tokens, $0.089520 cost  

The errors are due to the fact that the operations "multiplied by" and "divided by" are not being correctly parsed by the `split` method. The `split` method is splitting the string at every space, so "multiplied by" and "divided by" are being split into two parts: "multiplied" and "by", "divided" and "by". 

To fix this, we need to modify the way we split the question into parts. Instead of splitting at every space, we should split at every space that is not part of "multiplied by" or "divided by". 

Here are the steps to fix the code:

1. Modify the `split` method to correctly split the question into parts.

Here is the edit block for the changes:

```python
wordy.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Split the question into parts
    parts = question.split()
=======
    # Split the question into parts
    parts = [part for part in re.split(r'(\D+)', question) if part.strip()]
>>>>>>> updated
```

2. Modify the loop to correctly get the operation and the next number. 

Here is the edit block for the changes:

```python
wordy.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Iterate over the rest of the parts
    for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):
        # Get the operation and the next number
        operation = parts[i]
        number = int(parts[i+1])
=======
    # Iterate over the rest of the parts
    for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):
        # Get the operation and the next number
        operation = parts[i].strip()
        number = int(parts[i+1].strip())
>>>>>>> updated
```

3. Modify the if-else block to correctly perform the operation based on the operation string.

Here is the edit block for the changes:

```python
wordy.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Perform the operation
    if operation == 'plus':
        answer += number
    elif operation == 'minus':
        answer -= number
    elif operation == 'multiplied by':
        answer *= number
    elif operation == 'divided by':
        answer //= number
    else:
        raise ValueError("unknown operation")
=======
    # Perform the operation
    if operation == 'plus':
        answer += number
    elif operation == 'minus':
        answer -= number
    elif operation == 'multiplied':
        answer *= number
    elif operation == 'divided':
        answer //= number
    else:
        raise ValueError("unknown operation")
>>>>>>> updated
```

Please note that you need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the file to use the `re.split` method. Here is the edit block for this change:

```python
wordy.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import re
>>>>>>> updated
```
