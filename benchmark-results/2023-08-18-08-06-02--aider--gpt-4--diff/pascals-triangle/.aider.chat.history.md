#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.  
####   
#### In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to the right and left of the current position in the previous row.  
####   
#### ```text  
####     1  
####    1 1  
####   1 2 1  
####  1 3 3 1  
#### 1 4 6 4 1  
#### # ... etc  
#### ```

#### ## How this Exercise is Implemented in Python: Recursion  
####   
#### This exercise is designed to be completed using [concept:python/recursion](), rather than loops.  
#### A recursive function is a function that calls itself, which is useful when solving problems that are defined in terms of themselves.  
#### To avoid infinite recursion (or more specifically, to avoid overflowing the stack), something called a "base case" is used.  
#### When the base case is reached, a non-recursive value is returned, which allows the previous function call to resolve and return its value, and so on, rippling back down the stack until the first function call returns the answer.  
#### We could write a recursive function to find the answer to 5! (i.e. 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) like so:  
####   
#### ````python  
#### def factorial(number):  
####   if number <= 1:  # base case  
####     return 1  
####   
####   return number * factorial(number - 1) # recursive case  
####   
#### print(factorial(5)) # returns 120  
#### ````  
####   
#### Finally, it should be noted that Python limits the number of times recursive calls can be made (1000 by default) and does not optimize for [tail recursion][tail-recursion].  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception][raising].  
#### When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.  
#### This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.  
#### For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][built-in-errors], but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise-statement] to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `rows()` function is passed a negative number.  
#### The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the rows function is passed a negative number.  
#### raise ValueError("number of rows is negative")  
#### ```

To implement the Pascal's Triangle, we will use a recursive approach. The base case will be when the row count is 0 or 1. In these cases, we will return a list with a single list containing 1. For other cases, we will calculate the current row based on the previous row and append it to the result.

We will also add a check at the beginning of the function to raise a ValueError if the row count is negative, as per the instructions.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Check if the row count is negative. If it is, raise a ValueError with a meaningful message.
2. Check if the row count is 0 or 1. If it is, return a list with a single list containing 1.
3. For other cases, recursively call the function with row count decreased by 1.
4. Calculate the current row based on the previous row. The first and last elements of the current row are 1. Other elements are the sum of two adjacent elements in the previous row.
5. Append the current row to the result and return it.

The file to modify is `pascals_triangle.py`.

Here is the edit block:

```python
pascals_triangle.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def rows(row_count):
    pass
=======
def rows(row_count):
    if row_count < 0:
        raise ValueError("number of rows is negative")
    if row_count == 0:
        return []
    if row_count == 1:
        return [[1]]
    # Recursive case
    previous_rows = rows(row_count - 1)
    last_row = previous_rows[-1]
    current_row = [1] + [last_row[i-1] + last_row[i] for i in range(1, len(last_row))] + [1]
    return previous_rows + [current_row]
