#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that makes an online multiplayer game called Lexiconia.  
####   
#### To play the game, each player is given 13 letters, which they must rearrange to create words.  
#### Different letters have different point values, since it's easier to create words with some letters than others.  
####   
#### The game was originally launched in English, but it is very popular, and now the company wants to expand to other languages as well.  
####   
#### Different languages need to support different point values for letters.  
#### The point values are determined by how often letters are used, compared to other letters in that language.  
####   
#### For example, the letter 'C' is quite common in English, and is only worth 3 points.  
#### But in Norwegian it's a very rare letter, and is worth 10 points.  
####   
#### To make it easier to add new languages, your team needs to change the way letters and their point values are stored in the game.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to change the data format of letters and their point values in the game.  
####   
#### Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping.  
####   
#### - 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",  
#### - 2 points: "D", "G",  
#### - 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",  
#### - 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",  
#### - 5 points: "K",  
#### - 8 points: "J", "X",  
#### - 10 points: "Q", "Z",  
####   
#### This needs to be changed to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.  
####   
#### - "a" is worth 1 point.  
#### - "b" is worth 3 points.  
#### - "c" is worth 3 points.  
#### - "d" is worth 2 points.  
#### - etc.  
####   
#### As part of this change, the team has also decided to change the letters to be lower-case rather than upper-case.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### If you want to look at how the data was previously structured and how it needs to change, take a look at the examples in the test suite.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: etl.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the transformation from the legacy data format to the new one, we need to modify the `transform` function in the `etl.py` file. 

The `transform` function should take a dictionary where the keys are the point values and the values are lists of letters that correspond to those point values. It should return a new dictionary where the keys are the lowercase letters and the values are their corresponding point values.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the new data format.
2. Iterate over each item in the legacy data. For each item:
   - The key is the point value and the value is a list of letters.
   - Iterate over each letter in the list.
   - Add an entry to the new dictionary where the key is the lowercase version of the letter and the value is the point value.
3. Return the new dictionary.

Here is the code change:

```python
etl.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def transform(legacy_data):
    pass
=======
def transform(legacy_data):
    new_data = {}
    for point_value, letters in legacy_data.items():
        for letter in letters:
            new_data[letter.lower()] = point_value
    return new_data
>>>>>>> updated
```

> Applied edit to etl.py
