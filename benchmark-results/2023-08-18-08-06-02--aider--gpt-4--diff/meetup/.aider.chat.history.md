#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recurring monthly meetups are generally scheduled on the given weekday of a given week each month.  
#### In this exercise you will be given the recurring schedule, along with a month and year, and then asked to find the exact date of the meetup.  
####   
#### For example a meetup might be scheduled on the _first Monday_ of every month.  
#### You might then be asked to find the date that this meetup will happen in January 2018.  
#### In other words, you need to determine the date of the first Monday of January 2018.  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
####   
#### The descriptors you are expected to process are: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### Note that descriptor `teenth` is a made-up word.  
####   
#### It refers to the seven numbers that end in '-teen' in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  
#### But general descriptions of dates use ordinal numbers, e.g. the _first_ Monday, the _third_ Tuesday.  
####   
#### For the numbers ending in '-teen', that becomes:  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### So there are seven numbers ending in '-teen'.  
#### And there are also seven weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).  
#### Therefore, it is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one numbered day ending with "teen" each month.  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953 (or, alternately the "Saturteenth" of August, 1953), we need to look at the calendar for August 1953:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### The Saturday that has a number ending in '-teen' is August 15, 1953.

#### ## Customizing and Raising Exceptions  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.  
####   
#### Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).  
####   
#### For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.  
####   
#### To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException  
#### class MeetupDayException(ValueError):  
####     """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.  
####   
####     message: explanation of the error.  
####   
####     """  
####     def __init__(self, message):  
####         self.message = message  
####   
####           
#### # raising a MeetupDayException  
#### raise MeetupDayException("That day does not exist.")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `meetup` function, we need to use the `calendar` module from Python's standard library. This module provides useful functions related to the calendar, such as `monthcalendar`, which returns a matrix representing a month's calendar. Each row represents a week and days outside of the specified month are set to 0.

The `meetup` function will take four parameters: `year`, `month`, `week`, and `day_of_week`. The `week` parameter can be one of the following: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`. The `day_of_week` parameter can be one of the following: `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, `Sunday`.

The function will first convert the `day_of_week` parameter to a number, where `Monday` is 0 and `Sunday` is 6. This is because the `monthcalendar` function represents weekdays as numbers in this way.

Then, the function will get the month's calendar and iterate over it to find the correct day. If the `week` parameter is `teenth`, the function will look for the day in the second and third weeks of the month (indices 1 and 2). If the `week` parameter is `last`, the function will look for the day in the last week of the month (last index). Otherwise, the function will convert the `week` parameter to a number and look for the day in the corresponding week.

If the function cannot find a valid day, it will raise a `MeetupDayException`.

Here are the changes to the `meetup.py` file:

```python
meetup.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self):
        pass


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    pass
=======
import calendar

# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException
class MeetupDayException(ValueError):
    """Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message


def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):
    # Convert day_of_week to a number
    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
    day_num = days.index(day_of_week)

    # Get the month's calendar
    month_cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)

    # Find the correct day
    if week == 'teenth':
        for i in [1, 2]:  # second and third weeks
            if month_cal[i][day_num] != 0:
                return year, month, month_cal[i][day_num]
    elif week == 'last':
        for i in reversed(range(len(month_cal))):  # last week
            if month_cal[i][day_num] != 0:
                return year, month, month_cal[i][day_num]
    else:
        week_num = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].index(week)
        if month_cal[week_num][day_num] != 0:
            return year, month, month_cal[week_num][day_num]

    # If no valid day was found, raise an exception
    raise MeetupDayException("That day does not exist.")
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code should work as expected according to the problem statement. However, please note that it assumes that the input parameters are valid (i.e., `week` is one of the specified strings and `day_of_week` is a valid weekday). If this is not the case, you might want to add some input validation code.

The error messages indicate that the `meetup` function in `meetup.py` is not handling the case when the `week` parameter is `fifth`. The function currently only handles `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `teenth`, and `last`. 

To fix this, we need to add a condition to handle the `fifth` week. We can do this by adding an `elif` clause after the `last` week condition. In this clause, we will iterate over the month's calendar in reverse order, starting from the last week, and look for the day in the fifth week of the month. If the day is not found in the fifth week, we will raise a `MeetupDayException`.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
meetup.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    elif week == 'last':
        for i in reversed(range(len(month_cal))):  # last week
            if month_cal[i][day_num] != 0:
                return year, month, month_cal[i][day_num]
    else:
        week_num = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].index(week)
        if month_cal[week_num][day_num] != 0:
            return year, month, month_cal[week_num][day_num]
=======
    elif week == 'last' or week == 'fifth':
        for i in reversed(range(len(month_cal))):  # last week
            if month_cal[i][day_num] != 0:
                if week == 'last' or (week == 'fifth' and i == 4):
                    return year, month, month_cal[i][day_num]
    else:
        week_num = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].index(week)
        if month_cal[week_num][day_num] != 0:
            return year, month, month_cal[week_num][day_num]
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change should fix the errors. The `meetup` function will now correctly handle the `fifth` week.
