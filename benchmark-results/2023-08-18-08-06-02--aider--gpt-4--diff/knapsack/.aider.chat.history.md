#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, let's try to solve a classic problem.  
####   
#### Bob is a thief.  
#### After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a high-class apartment.  
####   
#### In front of him are many items, each with a value (v) and weight (w).  
#### Bob, of course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly take all of the items if he could.  
#### However, to his horror, he realizes that the knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).  
####   
#### Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine the maximum value he can get from the items in the house.  
#### Note that Bob can take only one of each item.  
####   
#### All values given will be strictly positive.  
#### Items will be represented as a list of pairs, `wi` and `vi`, where the first element `wi` is the weight of the *i*th item and `vi` is the value for that item.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Items: [  
####   { "weight": 5, "value": 10 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 40 },  
####   { "weight": 6, "value": 30 },  
####   { "weight": 4, "value": 50 }  
#### ]  
####   
#### Knapsack Limit: 10  
####   
#### For the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.  
####   
#### In this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.  
#### He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: knapsack.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D array where the row represents the items up to i and the column represents the weight up to w. Each cell will store the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight limit and items. 

Here are the steps to implement this:

1. Initialize a 2D array of size (n+1) x (W+1) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight. The first row and the first column will be initialized to 0 as they represent the case when there are no items or the weight limit is 0.

2. For each item, iterate through all possible weights from 1 to W. For each weight, we have two options: either we include the current item or we don't. If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current weight, we take the maximum of two cases: (1) including the current item (value of the current item + value of the remaining weight from the previous row) and (2) not including the current item (value from the previous row). If the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight, we can't include the current item, so we just take the value from the previous row.

3. The maximum value that can be obtained is stored in the last cell of the array.

Let's implement this in the `maximum_value` function in the `knapsack.py` file.

```python
knapsack.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    pass
=======
def maximum_value(maximum_weight, items):
    n = len(items)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(maximum_weight + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, maximum_weight + 1):
            if items[i - 1]['weight'] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(items[i - 1]['value'] + dp[i - 1][w - items[i - 1]['weight']], dp[i - 1][w])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]

    return dp[n][maximum_weight]
>>>>>>> updated
```
This function takes the maximum weight and the list of items as input and returns the maximum value that can be obtained. The time complexity of this function is O(nW) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight. The space complexity is also O(nW).
