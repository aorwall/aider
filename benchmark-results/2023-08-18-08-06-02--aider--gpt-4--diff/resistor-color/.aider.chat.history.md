#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   
#### To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### Each band has a position and a numeric value.  
####   
#### The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.  
####   
#### In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
####   
#### These colors are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to create a way:  
####   
#### - to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band  
#### - to list the different band colors  
####   
#### Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:  
#### Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.  
####   
#### More information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].  
####   
#### [e-color-code]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `resistor_color.py` file. 

The `color_code(color)` function should return the numerical value associated with the input color. We can achieve this by creating a dictionary where the keys are the color names and the values are their corresponding numerical values. Then, we simply return the value associated with the input color.

The `colors()` function should return a list of all the color names. We can achieve this by returning the keys of the dictionary we created for the `color_code(color)` function.

Here are the changes:

```python
resistor_color.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def color_code(color):
    pass


def colors():
    pass
=======
COLORS = {
    "black": 0,
    "brown": 1,
    "red": 2,
    "orange": 3,
    "yellow": 4,
    "green": 5,
    "blue": 6,
    "violet": 7,
    "grey": 8,
    "white": 9
}

def color_code(color):
    return COLORS[color]


def colors():
    return list(COLORS.keys())
>>>>>>> updated
```
