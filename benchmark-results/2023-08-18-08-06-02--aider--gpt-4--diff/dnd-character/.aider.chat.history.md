#### # Instructions  
####   
#### For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd], each player starts by generating a character they can play with.  
#### This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.  
#### These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.  
#### You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.  
#### You do this six times, once for each ability.  
####   
#### Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.  
#### You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.  
####   
#### Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.  
####   
#### For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:  
####   
#### - 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.  
#### - 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.  
#### - 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.  
#### - 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.  
#### - 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.  
#### - 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.  
####   
#### Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.  
####   
#### ## Notes  
####   
#### Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few programming languages are designed to roll dice.  
#### One such language is [Troll][troll].

To implement the character generator, we need to modify the `Character` class in the `dnd_character.py` file. 

We will add six attributes to the `Character` class: `strength`, `dexterity`, `constitution`, `intelligence`, `wisdom`, and `charisma`. Each attribute will be assigned a value generated by the `roll_dice` method, which simulates the rolling of four 6-sided dice and returns the sum of the three highest rolls.

We will also add a `hitpoints` attribute, which is calculated as 10 plus the constitution modifier. The constitution modifier is calculated by subtracting 10 from the constitution, dividing by 2, and rounding down.

Here are the changes:

```python
dnd_character.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
=======
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_dice()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_dice()
        self.constitution = self.roll_dice()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_dice()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_dice()
        self.charisma = self.roll_dice()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + ((self.constitution - 10) // 2)

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice():
        rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        return sum(sorted(rolls)[1:])
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses the `random.randint` function from the standard Python `random` module to simulate dice rolls. The `roll_dice` method rolls four dice (generates four random numbers between 1 and 6), sorts the results, discards the lowest roll, and sums the remaining three rolls. The `//` operator is used for integer division when calculating the constitution modifier, which ensures that the result is rounded down.

The error message indicates that the test module `dnd_character_test` is trying to import a function named `modifier` from `dnd_character.py`, but it cannot find such a function. 

To fix this, we need to add a `modifier` function to `dnd_character.py`. This function should take an ability score as an argument and return the modifier for that score. According to the rules of Dungeons & Dragons, the modifier for an ability score is calculated as `(score - 10) // 2`.

Here is the change that needs to be made:

```python
dnd_character.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
import random

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_dice()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_dice()
        self.constitution = self.roll_dice()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_dice()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_dice()
        self.charisma = self.roll_dice()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + ((self.constitution - 10) // 2)

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice():
        rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        return sum(sorted(rolls)[1:])
=======
import random

def modifier(score):
    return (score - 10) // 2

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strength = self.roll_dice()
        self.dexterity = self.roll_dice()
        self.constitution = self.roll_dice()
        self.intelligence = self.roll_dice()
        self.wisdom = self.roll_dice()
        self.charisma = self.roll_dice()
        self.hitpoints = 10 + modifier(self.constitution)

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice():
        rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(4)]
        return sum(sorted(rolls)[1:])
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change adds the `modifier` function and uses it to calculate the `hitpoints` attribute in the `Character` class.
