#### # Instructions  
####   
#### An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.  
#### A word is not its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.  
####   
#### Given a target word and a set of candidate words, this exercise requests the anagram set: the subset of the candidates that are anagrams of the target.  
####   
#### The target and candidates are words of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).  
#### Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `StoP` is not an anagram of `sTOp`.  
#### The anagram set is the subset of the candidate set that are anagrams of the target (in any order).  
#### Words in the anagram set should have the same letter case as in the candidate set.  
####   
#### Given the target `"stone"` and candidates `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`, the anagram set is `"tones"`, `"notes"`, `"Seton"`.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: anagram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `find_anagrams` function, we need to modify the `anagram.py` file. 

The function will work as follows:

1. Convert the target word to lowercase and sort its characters. This will be our reference for comparison.
2. Iterate over the candidates list.
3. For each candidate, convert it to lowercase and sort its characters.
4. If the sorted candidate is equal to the sorted target and the candidate (in its original case) is not equal to the target, add the candidate to the anagram list.
5. Return the anagram list.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
anagram.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    pass
=======
def find_anagrams(word, candidates):
    target = sorted(word.lower())
    return [candidate for candidate in candidates if sorted(candidate.lower()) == target and candidate.lower() != word.lower()]
>>>>>>> updated
```
