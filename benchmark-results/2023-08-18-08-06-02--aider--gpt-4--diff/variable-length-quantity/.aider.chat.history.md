#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the sequence is incomplete  
#### raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the variable length quantity encoding and decoding, we need to modify the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `variable_length_quantity.py` file.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. For the `encode` function:
   - We need to iterate over the input numbers.
   - For each number, we need to convert it to binary and split it into 7-bit chunks.
   - We need to add a '1' to the start of each chunk except the last one, and a '0' to the start of the last chunk.
   - We need to convert each chunk back to an integer and add it to the result list.

2. For the `decode` function:
   - We need to iterate over the input bytes.
   - For each byte, we need to convert it to binary and remove the first bit.
   - We need to concatenate the chunks until we find a chunk that starts with '0'.
   - We need to convert the concatenated chunks to an integer and add it to the result list.
   - If we reach the end of the input bytes and the last chunk starts with '1', we need to raise a ValueError with the message "incomplete sequence".

Let's implement these changes.

```python
variable_length_quantity.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def encode(numbers):
    pass


def decode(bytes_):
    pass
=======
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        chunks = [bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)[i:i+7] for i in range(0, len(bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)), 7)]
        for i in range(len(chunks) - 1):
            chunks[i] = '1' + chunks[i]
        chunks[-1] = '0' + chunks[-1]
        result.extend([int(chunk, 2) for chunk in chunks])
    return result


def decode(bytes_):
    result = []
    number = ''
    for byte in bytes_:
        if byte >> 7 == 1:
            number += bin(byte & 0b01111111)[2:].zfill(7)
        else:
            number += bin(byte)[2:].zfill(7)
            result.append(int(number, 2))
            number = ''
    if number != '':
        raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code should work as expected according to the instructions. However, it's always a good idea to test the code with different inputs to make sure it works in all cases.

The errors in the tests are due to incorrect encoding of the numbers in the `encode` function. The first bit of each byte in the encoded number should be '1' for all bytes except the last one, which should start with '0'. However, in the current implementation, the first bit of each byte is '0' for all bytes except the last one, which starts with '1'. This is the opposite of what it should be.

To fix this, we need to modify the `encode` function in the `variable_length_quantity.py` file. 

Here is the step-by-step plan to fix the issue:

1. In the `encode` function, when converting each number to binary and splitting it into 7-bit chunks, we need to reverse the order of the chunks. This is because the first bit of the last byte in the encoded number should be '0', and the first bit of all other bytes should be '1'. By reversing the order of the chunks, we ensure that the last chunk (which will become the first byte in the encoded number) starts with '0', and all other chunks (which will become the other bytes in the encoded number) start with '1'.

2. After reversing the order of the chunks, we need to add '1' to the start of each chunk except the last one, and add '0' to the start of the last chunk. This is the opposite of what the current implementation does.

3. Finally, we need to reverse the order of the chunks again before converting them back to integers and adding them to the result list. This is because the bytes in the encoded number should be in the same order as the chunks in the binary representation of the number.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
variable_length_quantity.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        chunks = [bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)[i:i+7] for i in range(0, len(bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)), 7)]
        for i in range(len(chunks) - 1):
            chunks[i] = '1' + chunks[i]
        chunks[-1] = '0' + chunks[-1]
        result.extend([int(chunk, 2) for chunk in chunks])
    return result
=======
def encode(numbers):
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        chunks = [bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)[i:i+7] for i in range(0, len(bin(number)[2:].zfill(7)), 7)][::-1]
        for i in range(len(chunks) - 1):
            chunks[i] = '1' + chunks[i]
        chunks[-1] = '0' + chunks[-1]
        result.extend([int(chunk, 2) for chunk in chunks][::-1])
    return result
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change should fix the errors in the tests.
