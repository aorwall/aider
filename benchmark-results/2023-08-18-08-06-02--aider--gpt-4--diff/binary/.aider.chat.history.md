#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.  
####   
#### Implement binary to decimal conversion.  
#### Given a binary input string, your program should produce a decimal output.  
#### The program should handle invalid inputs.  
####   
#### ## Note  
####   
#### - Implement the conversion yourself.  
####   Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.  
####   
#### ## About Binary (Base-2)  
####   
#### Decimal is a base-10 system.  
####   
#### A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:  
####   
#### - The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1  
#### - The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10  
#### - ...  
#### - The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.  
#### - All these values are summed.  
####   
#### So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`  
####   
#### Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.  
####   
#### So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # example when the argument passed is not a valid binary literal  
#### raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + digits)  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the binary to decimal conversion, we need to modify the `parse_binary` function in the `binary.py` file. 

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Check if the input string is a valid binary number. A valid binary number should only contain '0's and '1's. If the input string contains any other characters, we should raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message.
2. If the input string is a valid binary number, we can convert it to a decimal number. We start from the rightmost digit, multiply it by 2 raised to the power of its position, and add all these values together.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
binary.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    pass
=======
def parse_binary(binary_string):
    if not all(char in '01' for char in binary_string):
        raise ValueError("Invalid binary literal: " + binary_string)
    
    return sum(int(bit) * 2**i for i, bit in enumerate(binary_string[::-1]))
>>>>>>> updated
```

In the updated code, we first check if all characters in the input string are either '0' or '1'. If not, we raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating the invalid binary literal. Then, we use a list comprehension to calculate the decimal value of each binary digit and sum them up. The `enumerate` function is used to get the position of each digit, and the input string is reversed (`binary_string[::-1]`) because we start from the rightmost digit.
