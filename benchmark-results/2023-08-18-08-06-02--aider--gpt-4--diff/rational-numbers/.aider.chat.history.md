#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Note that mathematically, the denominator can't be zero.  
#### However in many implementations of rational numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.  
#### In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.  
####   
#### The sum of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ + r₂ = a₁/b₁ + a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The difference of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ - r₂ = a₁/b₁ - a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ * r₂ = (a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### Dividing a rational number `r₁ = a₁/b₁` by another `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ / r₂ = (a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)` if `a₂` is not zero.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,  
#### - absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.  
####   
#### Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.  
#### For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.  
#### To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.  
#### So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.  
#### The reduced form of a rational number should be in "standard form" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).  
#### If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.  
#### For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`  
####   
#### Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.  
####

To implement the operations for the Rational class, we need to modify the `rational_numbers.py` file. 

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. In the `__init__` method, we need to set `self.numer` and `self.denom` to `numer` and `denom` respectively. We also need to ensure that the rational number is always in its reduced form. We can do this by dividing `numer` and `denom` by their greatest common divisor (gcd). We can use the `math.gcd` function from the standard Python library to find the gcd. If the denominator is negative, we should multiply both the numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure the rational number is in standard form.

2. Implement the `__add__` method to add two rational numbers. The formula for this is `(a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

3. Implement the `__sub__` method to subtract two rational numbers. The formula for this is `(a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

4. Implement the `__mul__` method to multiply two rational numbers. The formula for this is `(a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.

5. Implement the `__truediv__` method to divide two rational numbers. The formula for this is `(a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)`. We need to ensure that `a₂` is not zero.

6. Implement the `__abs__` method to return the absolute value of a rational number. The formula for this is `|a|/|b|`.

7. Implement the `__pow__` method to raise a rational number to a power. If the power is a non-negative integer, the formula is `(a^n)/(b^n)`. If the power is a negative integer, the formula is `(b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`. If the power is a real number, the formula is `(a^x)/(b^x)`.

8. Implement the `__rpow__` method to raise a real number to a rational number. The formula for this is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`. We can use the `**` operator in Python to calculate the power and the root.

Let's start with the `__init__` method.

The error messages indicate that the `numer` attribute of the `Rational` class is `None`. This is because we haven't assigned any value to `self.numer` and `self.denom` in the `__init__` method. We need to assign `numer` and `denom` to `self.numer` and `self.denom` respectively. We also need to ensure that the rational number is always in its reduced form and in standard form.

Here is the code change for the `__init__` method:

```python
rational_numbers.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        self.numer = None
        self.denom = None
=======
    import math
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        gcd = math.gcd(numer, denom)
        self.numer = numer // gcd
        self.denom = denom // gcd
        if self.denom < 0:
            self.numer *= -1
            self.denom *= -1
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numer` and `denom` using the `math.gcd` function. It then divides `numer` and `denom` by the gcd to reduce the rational number to its lowest terms. If the denominator is negative, it multiplies both the numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure the rational number is in standard form.
