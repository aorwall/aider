#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.  
####   
#### Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.  
#### It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.  
####   
#### - **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.  
####   Please note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay").  
#### - **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.  
####   Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, such as the "ch" in "chair" or "st" in "stand" (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").  
#### - **Rule 3**: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay").  
#### - **Rule 4**: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word it makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").  
####   
#### There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.  
#### Check the tests for all the details.  
####   
#### Read more about [Pig Latin on Wikipedia][pig-latin].  
####   
#### [pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig_latin.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Pig Latin translator, we need to modify the `translate` function in the `pig_latin.py` file. 

The steps to implement the function are as follows:

1. Split the input text into words.
2. For each word, check the first letter or letters to determine which rule to apply.
3. If the word starts with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u, xr, yt), add "ay" to the end of the word.
4. If the word starts with a consonant sound, move the consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and add "ay".
5. If the word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move the consonant and "qu" to the end of the word and add "ay".
6. If the word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word, treat it as a vowel sound and apply the appropriate rule.
7. Join the translated words back together into a sentence.

Here is the *edit block* for the `translate` function:

```python
pig_latin.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def translate(text):
    pass
=======
import re

def translate(text):
    words = text.split()
    translated_words = []

    for word in words:
        if re.match('^(xr|yt|[aeiou])', word):
            # Rule 1: word begins with a vowel sound
            translated_word = word + 'ay'
        elif re.match('^(qu|[^aeiou]+qu)', word):
            # Rule 3: word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu"
            match = re.match('^(qu|[^aeiou]+qu)', word)
            translated_word = word[match.end():] + match.group() + 'ay'
        elif re.match('^[^aeiouy]+', word):
            # Rule 2: word begins with a consonant sound
            match = re.match('^[^aeiouy]+', word)
            translated_word = word[match.end():] + match.group() + 'ay'
        else:
            # Rule 4: word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word
            match = re.match('^[^aeiou]*y', word)
            translated_word = word[match.end():] + match.group() + 'ay'

        translated_words.append(translated_word)

    return ' '.join(translated_words)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses regular expressions to match the different rules for translating to Pig Latin. The `re.match` function is used to match the start of the word to the different rules. The `re.match` function returns a match object if the pattern is found, or `None` if it is not. The `group` method of the match object is used to get the matched string, and the `end` method is used to get the position where the match ends. This is used to slice the word and rearrange it according to the rules. The translated words are then joined back together into a sentence.
