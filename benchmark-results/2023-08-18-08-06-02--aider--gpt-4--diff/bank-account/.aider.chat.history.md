#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
#### Watch out for concurrent transactions!  
####   
#### A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways.  
#### Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc.  
#### Shops can charge against the account.  
####   
#### Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language).  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` for when an account is or is not open, or the withdrawal/deposit amounts are incorrect. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:    
####   
####   
#### ```python  
#### # account is not open  
#### raise ValueError('account not open')  
####   
#### # account is already open  
#### raise ValueError('account already open')  
####   
#### # incorrect withdrawal/deposit amount  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')  
####   
#### # withdrawal is too big  
#### raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the bank account functionality, we need to modify the `BankAccount` class in the `bank_account.py` file. 

The modifications will include:
1. Adding an instance variable `balance` to keep track of the account balance.
2. Adding an instance variable `status` to keep track of whether the account is open or closed.
3. Implementing the `open`, `close`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods.
4. Adding error handling for invalid operations such as withdrawing more than the balance, depositing or withdrawing negative amounts, and performing operations on a closed account.

Here are the changes:

```python
bank_account.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_balance(self):
        pass

    def open(self):
        pass

    def deposit(self, amount):
        pass

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        pass

    def close(self):
        pass
=======
import threading

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0
        self.status = False
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_balance(self):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        return self.balance

    def open(self):
        if self.status:
            raise ValueError('account already open')
        self.status = True
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        with self.lock:
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount < 0 or amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
        with self.lock:
            self.balance -= amount

    def close(self):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        self.status = False
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses a lock to ensure that the deposit and withdraw operations are thread-safe. The lock is acquired before modifying the balance and released after the modification is complete. This prevents race conditions where two threads might try to modify the balance at the same time.

The error message indicates that the test is expecting the error message "amount must be greater than 0" when trying to withdraw a negative amount. However, the current implementation of the `withdraw` method in the `BankAccount` class is throwing the error message "amount must be less than balance". 

To fix this, we need to modify the `withdraw` method in the `BankAccount` class to first check if the amount is less than 0 and throw the appropriate error message.

Here is the change that needs to be made in the `bank_account.py` file:

```python
bank_account.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount < 0 or amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
        with self.lock:
            self.balance -= amount
=======
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if not self.status:
            raise ValueError('account not open')
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError('amount must be greater than 0')
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError('amount must be less than balance')
        with self.lock:
            self.balance -= amount
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change separates the check for a negative amount and an amount greater than the balance into two separate if statements, each with their own error message. This will ensure that the correct error message is thrown when a negative amount is attempted to be withdrawn.
