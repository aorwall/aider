#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed.  
#### All known life depends on DNA!  
####   
#### > Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.  
####   
#### DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.  
#### A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!  
#### We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".  
####   
#### We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.  
#### 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.  
####   
#### Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.  
#### If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2  
#### "INVALID" -> error  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: nucleotide_count.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `nucleotide_count.py` file. 

The `count` function should take a DNA sequence and a nucleotide as arguments, and return the count of the nucleotide in the sequence. If the sequence contains any characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', it should raise an error.

The `nucleotide_counts` function should take a DNA sequence as an argument, and return a dictionary with the counts of each nucleotide in the sequence. If the sequence contains any characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', it should raise an error.

Here are the changes:

```python
nucleotide_count.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    pass


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    pass
=======
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return {'A': strand.count('A'), 'C': strand.count('C'), 'G': strand.count('G'), 'T': strand.count('T')}
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes will implement the functionality as described in the instructions. The `count` function will return the count of a specific nucleotide in the DNA sequence, and the `nucleotide_counts` function will return a dictionary with the counts of all nucleotides in the sequence. Both functions will raise a `ValueError` if the DNA sequence contains any characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

The error message indicates that a `ValueError` is not being raised when expected. This likely means that the validation check in the `count` and `nucleotide_counts` functions is not working as expected.

Let's modify the `count` and `nucleotide_counts` functions to correctly raise a `ValueError` when the DNA sequence contains characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

Here are the changes:

```python
nucleotide_count.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return {'A': strand.count('A'), 'C': strand.count('C'), 'G': strand.count('G'), 'T': strand.count('T')}
=======
def count(strand, nucleotide):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand + nucleotide):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return strand.count(nucleotide)


def nucleotide_counts(strand):
    if not all(n in 'ACGT' for n in strand):
        raise ValueError("Invalid DNA sequence")
    return {'A': strand.count('A'), 'C': strand.count('C'), 'G': strand.count('G'), 'T': strand.count('T')}
>>>>>>> updated
```

In the `count` function, I've added the `nucleotide` argument to the validation check. This is because the `nucleotide` argument should also be validated to ensure it is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If it is not, a `ValueError` should be raised. The `nucleotide_counts` function remains unchanged as it already correctly validates the `strand` argument.
