#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the square code cipher, we need to follow these steps:

1. Normalize the input text by removing spaces, punctuation, and converting to lowercase.
2. Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle.
3. Organize the normalized text into a rectangle.
4. Read the encoded message by reading down the columns from left to right.
5. Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles, with trailing spaces for short phrases.

We will modify the `cipher_text` function in the `crypto_square.py` file to implement these steps.

Here is the proposed change:

```python
crypto_square.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def cipher_text(plain_text):
    pass
=======
import math
import re

def cipher_text(plain_text):
    # Step 1: Normalize the input text
    normalized_text = re.sub(r'\W+', '', plain_text).lower()

    # Step 2: Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle
    length = len(normalized_text)
    c = math.ceil(math.sqrt(length))
    r = c if c * (c - 1) < length else c - 1

    # Step 3: Organize the normalized text into a rectangle
    rectangle = [normalized_text[i:i+c] for i in range(0, length, c)]

    # Step 4: Read the encoded message by reading down the columns from left to right
    encoded_message = ''.join([''.join([row[j] if j < len(row) else ' ' for row in rectangle]) for j in range(c)])

    # Step 5: Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles, with trailing spaces for short phrases
    return ' '.join([encoded_message[i:i+r] for i in range(0, len(encoded_message), r)])
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses the `math` library for mathematical operations and the `re` library for regular expressions to normalize the input text. The `cipher_text` function follows the steps outlined above to encode the input text using the square code cipher.

The error messages indicate that the `range()` function is receiving a zero value for its step argument, which is not allowed. This is happening because the variable `c` is being set to zero when the input `plain_text` is empty or only contains non-alphanumeric characters. 

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the `plain_text` is empty or only contains non-alphanumeric characters after normalization. If it is, we should return an empty string immediately, bypassing the rest of the function.

Here is the change we need to make:

```python
crypto_square.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Step 1: Normalize the input text
    normalized_text = re.sub(r'\W+', '', plain_text).lower()

    # Step 2: Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle
    length = len(normalized_text)
    c = math.ceil(math.sqrt(length))
    r = c if c * (c - 1) < length else c - 1

    # Step 3: Organize the normalized text into a rectangle
    rectangle = [normalized_text[i:i+c] for i in range(0, length, c)]
=======
    # Step 1: Normalize the input text
    normalized_text = re.sub(r'\W+', '', plain_text).lower()

    # Check if the normalized text is empty
    if not normalized_text:
        return ''

    # Step 2: Determine the number of rows and columns for the rectangle
    length = len(normalized_text)
    c = math.ceil(math.sqrt(length))
    r = c if c * (c - 1) < length else c - 1

    # Step 3: Organize the normalized text into a rectangle
    rectangle = [normalized_text[i:i+c] for i in range(0, length, c)]
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change should fix the errors you're seeing in the tests.
