To implement the string reversal, we will modify the `reverse` function in the `reverse_string.py` file. We will use Python's slicing feature to reverse the string.

Here is the change:

```python
reverse_string.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def reverse(text):
    pass
=======
def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will replace the `pass` statement with a return statement that uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string. The `[::-1]` slice means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1, which is used for reversing a string.
