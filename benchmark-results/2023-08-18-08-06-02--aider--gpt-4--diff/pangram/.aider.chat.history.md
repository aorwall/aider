#### # Introduction  
####   
#### You work for a company that sells fonts through their website.  
#### They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website.  
#### To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use **all** the letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.  
#### You're in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Pangram comes from Greek, παν γράμμα, pan gramma, which means "every letter".  
####   
#### The best known English pangram is:  
####   
#### > The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
#### ~~~~  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram.  
####   
#### A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.  
#### It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. `k`) or upper-case (e.g. `K`).  
####   
#### For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pangram.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the `is_pangram` function, we need to check if all the letters of the English alphabet are present in the sentence. We can do this by creating a set of all the letters in the sentence and comparing it to a set of all the letters in the English alphabet. If the two sets are equal, then the sentence is a pangram.

Here is the change we need to make:

```python
pangram.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def is_pangram(sentence):
    pass
=======
def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
    sentence = set(sentence.lower())
    return alphabet.issubset(sentence)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code creates a set of all the lowercase letters in the English alphabet and a set of all the lowercase letters in the sentence. It then checks if all the letters in the alphabet are in the sentence by using the `issubset` method. If they are, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
