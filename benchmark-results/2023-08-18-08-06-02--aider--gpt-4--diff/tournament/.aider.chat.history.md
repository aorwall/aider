#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Tally the results of a small football competition.  
####   
#### Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P  
#### Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7  
#### Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6  
#### Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3  
#### Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1  
#### ```  
####   
#### What do those abbreviations mean?  
####   
#### - MP: Matches Played  
#### - W: Matches Won  
#### - D: Matches Drawn (Tied)  
#### - L: Matches Lost  
#### - P: Points  
####   
#### A win earns a team 3 points.  
#### A draw earns 1.  
#### A loss earns 0.  
####   
#### The outcome is ordered by points, descending.  
#### In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.  
####   
#### ## Input  
####   
#### Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win  
#### Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw  
#### Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win  
#### Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss  
#### Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss  
#### Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win  
#### ```  
####   
#### The result of the match refers to the first team listed.  
#### So this line:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win  
#### ```  
####   
#### means that the Allegoric Alaskans beat the Blithering Badgers.  
####   
#### This line:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss  
#### ```  
####   
#### means that the Blithering Badgers beat the Courageous Californians.  
####   
#### And this line:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw  
#### ```  
####   
#### means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tournament.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the tally function, we need to parse the input rows, calculate the scores for each team, and then format the output table.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the team data. The keys will be the team names and the values will be dictionaries with keys for 'MP', 'W', 'D', 'L', and 'P'.

2. Loop over the input rows. For each row, split the string into the two team names and the result.

3. Update the team data in the dictionary based on the result of the match. If a team name is not already in the dictionary, add it with initial values of 0 for 'MP', 'W', 'D', 'L', and 'P'.

4. After all rows have been processed, convert the team data into a list of strings, each string representing a row in the output table. The first row should be the header row. The remaining rows should be sorted first by points in descending order, and then alphabetically in ascending order.

5. Join the list of strings into a single string with a newline character between each string, and return this string.

Here is the code to implement these steps:

```python
tournament.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def tally(rows):
    pass
=======
def tally(rows):
    teams = {}

    for row in rows:
        team1, team2, result = row.split(';')

        if team1 not in teams:
            teams[team1] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}
        if team2 not in teams:
            teams[team2] = {'MP': 0, 'W': 0, 'D': 0, 'L': 0, 'P': 0}

        teams[team1]['MP'] += 1
        teams[team2]['MP'] += 1

        if result == 'win':
            teams[team1]['W'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 3
            teams[team2]['L'] += 1
        elif result == 'loss':
            teams[team2]['W'] += 1
            teams[team2]['P'] += 3
            teams[team1]['L'] += 1
        elif result == 'draw':
            teams[team1]['D'] += 1
            teams[team1]['P'] += 1
            teams[team2]['D'] += 1
            teams[team2]['P'] += 1

    table = ['Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P']
    for team, data in sorted(teams.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1]['P'], x[0])):
        table.append(f"{team:30} | {data['MP']:2} | {data['W']:2} | {data['D']:2} | {data['L']:2} | {data['P']:2}")

    return '\n'.join(table)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code should work correctly for the given problem. However, it assumes that the input rows are well-formed and does not handle any potential errors in the input data. If error handling is required, additional code would be needed.

The error messages indicate that the `tally` function in `tournament.py` is returning a string, while the tests are expecting a list of strings. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `tally` function to return a list of strings instead of a single string. 

Here is the change we need to make:

```python
tournament.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return '\n'.join(table)
=======
    return table
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will make the `tally` function return a list of strings, where each string is a line in the table. This should match the expected output in the tests.
