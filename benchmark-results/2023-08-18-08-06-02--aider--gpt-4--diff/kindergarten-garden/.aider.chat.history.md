#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is  
#### responsible for.  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in actual dirt, and grow actual plants.  
####   
#### They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
####   
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and  
#### planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available  
#### types of seeds.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,  
#### - Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,  
#### - Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row.  
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names.  
####   
#### The following diagram represents Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover

#### ## Python Implementation  
####   
#### The tests for this exercise expect your program to be implemented as a Garden `class` in Python.  
#### If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.  
####   
#### Your `class` should implement a `method` called plants, which takes a student's name as an argument and returns the `list` of plant names belonging to that student.  
####   
#### ## Constructors  
####   
#### Creating the example garden  
####   
#### ```  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### would, in the tests, be represented as `Garden("VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV")`.  
####   
#### To make this representation work, your `class` will need to implement an `__init__()` method.  
#### If you're not familiar with `__init__()` or _constructors_, [class and instance objects][class vs instance objects in python] from the Python docs gives a more detailed explanation.  
####   
####   
#### ## Default Parameters  
####   
#### In some tests, a `list` of students is passed as an argument to `__init__()`.  
#### This should override the twelve student roster provided in the problem statement.  
#### Both of these statements need to work with your `__init__()` method:  
####   
#### ```Python  
#### # Make a garden based on the default 12-student roster.  
#### Garden("VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV")   
####   
#### # Make a garden based on a 2-student roster.  
#### Garden("VRCC\nVCGG", students=["Valorie", "Raven"])   
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### One approach is to make the student `list` a [default argument][default argument values]; the Python docs describe `default parameters` in depth while explaining [function definitions][function definitions].

#### [function definitions]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions  
####

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Garden class as per the instructions, we need to modify the `kindergarten_garden.py` file. 

The `Garden` class should have the following attributes and methods:

1. `__init__(self, diagram, students)`: This is the constructor of the class. It should initialize the `diagram` and `students` attributes. The `students` attribute should be sorted alphabetically. We also need to map the plant initials to their full names.

2. `plants(self, student)`: This method should return a list of plants that belong to the given student. We need to find the index of the student in the `students` list, then use this index to find the corresponding plants in the `diagram`.

Here is the code modification for the `kindergarten_garden.py` file:

```python
kindergarten_garden.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Garden:
    def __init__(self, diagram, students):
        pass
=======
class Garden:
    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        self.diagram = diagram.split('\n')
        self.students = sorted(students) if students else ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Fred', 'Ginny', 'Harriet', 'Ileana', 'Joseph', 'Kincaid', 'Larry']
        self.plant_names = {'V': 'Violets', 'R': 'Radishes', 'C': 'Clover', 'G': 'Grass'}

    def plants(self, student):
        index = self.students.index(student)
        plants_initials = [row[index*2:index*2+2] for row in self.diagram]
        return [self.plant_names[initial] for initials in plants_initials for initial in initials]
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code will work as per the instructions given. The `__init__` method initializes the `diagram`, `students`, and `plant_names` attributes. The `plants` method finds the index of the given student in the `students` list, then uses this index to find the corresponding plants in the `diagram`. It then returns a list of full plant names.
