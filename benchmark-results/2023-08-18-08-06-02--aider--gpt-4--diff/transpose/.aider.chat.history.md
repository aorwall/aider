#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an input text output it transposed.  
####   
#### Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### is given by:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### CF  
#### ```  
####   
#### Rows become columns and columns become rows.  
#### See [transpose][].  
####   
#### If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:  
####   
#### - Pad to the left with spaces.  
#### - Don't pad to the right.  
####   
#### Therefore, transposing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DE  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### C  
#### ```  
####   
#### And transposing:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AB  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
####  F  
#### ```  
####   
#### In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.  
#### That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the transpose function, we need to modify the `transpose.py` file. 

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Split the input text into lines.
2. Find the maximum length of the lines. This will be the number of rows in the transposed text.
3. Initialize an empty list of lists to hold the transposed text.
4. Iterate over each line in the input text. For each line, iterate over each character. If the character's index is greater than the length of the transposed text, append a new list to the transposed text. Then, append the character to the appropriate list in the transposed text.
5. Join the characters in each list in the transposed text into a string, and then join the lists into a single string with newline characters between each list.

Here is the code change:

```python
transpose.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def transpose(lines):
    pass
=======
def transpose(lines):
    lines = lines.split('\n')
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)
    transposed = [[] for _ in range(max_length)]
    for line in lines:
        for i, char in enumerate(line):
            while len(transposed[i]) < len(lines) - 1:
                transposed[i].append(' ')
            transposed[i].append(char)
    return '\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in transposed)
>>>>>>> updated
```

The error message indicates that there are extra spaces at the beginning of each line in the transposed text. This is likely due to the way we are padding the transposed text with spaces. 

We are appending spaces to the transposed text whenever the current character's index is greater than the length of the transposed text. However, this is not correct. We should be appending spaces to the transposed text whenever the current line's length is less than the maximum line length.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
transpose.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def transpose(lines):
    lines = lines.split('\n')
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)
    transposed = [[] for _ in range(max_length)]
    for line in lines:
        for i, char in enumerate(line):
            while len(transposed[i]) < len(lines) - 1:
                transposed[i].append(' ')
            transposed[i].append(char)
    return '\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in transposed)
=======
def transpose(lines):
    lines = lines.split('\n')
    max_length = max(len(line) for line in lines)
    transposed = [[' ']*len(lines) for _ in range(max_length)]
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        for j, char in enumerate(line):
            transposed[j][i] = char
    return '\n'.join(''.join(row).rstrip() for row in transposed)
>>>>>>> updated
```

In the updated code, we initialize the transposed text with spaces, and then replace the spaces with characters from the input text. We also use the `rstrip` function to remove trailing spaces from each line in the transposed text.
