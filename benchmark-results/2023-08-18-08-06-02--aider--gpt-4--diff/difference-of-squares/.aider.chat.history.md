#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.  
####   
#### The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.  
####   
#### The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is  
#### 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.  
####   
#### Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.  
####   
#### You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.  
#### Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: difference_of_squares.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we need to implement the three functions in the `difference_of_squares.py` file. 

1. `square_of_sum(number)`: This function should return the square of the sum of the first `number` natural numbers. We can calculate the sum of the first `number` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`, and then square the result.

2. `sum_of_squares(number)`: This function should return the sum of the squares of the first `number` natural numbers. We can calculate this using the formula `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`.

3. `difference_of_squares(number)`: This function should return the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first `number` natural numbers. We can calculate this by subtracting the result of `sum_of_squares(number)` from `square_of_sum(number)`.

Here are the changes to make:

```python
difference_of_squares.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def square_of_sum(number):
    pass


def sum_of_squares(number):
    pass


def difference_of_squares(number):
    pass
=======
def square_of_sum(number):
    sum_of_numbers = number * (number + 1) // 2
    return sum_of_numbers ** 2


def sum_of_squares(number):
    return number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1) // 6


def difference_of_squares(number):
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number)
