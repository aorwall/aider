#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.  
####   
#### ## Letter Values  
####   
#### You'll need these:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Letter                           Value  
#### A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1  
#### D, G                               2  
#### B, C, M, P                         3  
#### F, H, V, W, Y                      4  
#### K                                  5  
#### J, X                               8  
#### Q, Z                               10  
#### ```  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### "cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:  
####   
#### - 3 points for C  
#### - 1 point for A, twice  
#### - 3 points for B, twice  
#### - 2 points for G  
#### - 1 point for E  
####   
#### And to total:  
####   
#### - `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`  
#### - = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`  
#### - = `5 + 9`  
#### - = 14  
####   
#### ## Extensions  
####   
#### - You can play a double or a triple letter.  
#### - You can play a double or a triple word.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: scrabble_score.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Scrabble score calculation, we need to create a dictionary that maps each letter to its corresponding score. Then, for each letter in the input word, we add the score of that letter to a total score.

Here are the steps to implement this:

1. Create a dictionary `LETTER_SCORES` that maps each letter to its corresponding score.
2. In the `score` function, initialize a variable `total_score` to 0.
3. Convert the input word to uppercase (since our dictionary keys are uppercase letters).
4. For each letter in the word, add the score of that letter (from the `LETTER_SCORES` dictionary) to `total_score`.
5. Return `total_score`.

Here is the code change:

```python
scrabble_score.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def score(word):
    pass
=======
LETTER_SCORES = {
    'A': 1, 'E': 1, 'I': 1, 'O': 1, 'U': 1, 'L': 1, 'N': 1, 'R': 1, 'S': 1, 'T': 1,
    'D': 2, 'G': 2,
    'B': 3, 'C': 3, 'M': 3, 'P': 3,
    'F': 4, 'H': 4, 'V': 4, 'W': 4, 'Y': 4,
    'K': 5,
    'J': 8, 'X': 8,
    'Q': 10, 'Z': 10
}

def score(word):
    total_score = 0
    for letter in word.upper():
        total_score += LETTER_SCORES[letter]
    return total_score
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code does not yet handle the extensions (double or triple letters or words). If you want to implement those, please provide more details on how they should work.
