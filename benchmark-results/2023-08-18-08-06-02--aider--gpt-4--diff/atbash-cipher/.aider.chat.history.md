#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.  
####   
#### The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.  
#### The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.  
####   
#### An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
#### Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba  
#### ```  
####   
#### It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.  
#### However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.  
####   
#### Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.  
#### This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries.  
#### All text will be encoded as lowercase letters.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### - Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`  
#### - Encoding `x123 yes` gives `c123b vh`  
#### - Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`  
#### - Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: atbash_cipher.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Atbash cipher, we need to modify the `encode` and `decode` functions in the `atbash_cipher.py` file.

The `encode` function should:
1. Convert the input text to lowercase.
2. Remove any non-alphanumeric characters.
3. Replace each letter with its mirror image in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', etc.).
4. Leave numbers unchanged.
5. Group the resulting characters into groups of 5.

The `decode` function should:
1. Remove any non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Replace each letter with its mirror image in the alphabet.
3. Leave numbers unchanged.

Here are the changes:

```python
atbash_cipher.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def encode(plain_text):
    pass

def decode(ciphered_text):
    pass
=======
import string

def encode(plain_text):
    plain_text = plain_text.lower()
    ciphered_text = ''
    for char in plain_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ciphered_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isnumeric():
            ciphered_text += char
    ciphered_text = ' '.join(ciphered_text[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(ciphered_text), 5))
    return ciphered_text

def decode(ciphered_text):
    plain_text = ''
    for char in ciphered_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            plain_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isnumeric():
            plain_text += char
    return plain_text
>>>>>>> updated
```

In the `encode` function, we first convert the input text to lowercase. Then, for each character in the input text, if it's a letter, we calculate its mirror image in the alphabet by subtracting its ASCII value from 219 (which is the sum of the ASCII values of 'a' and 'z'). If it's a number, we leave it unchanged. Finally, we group the resulting characters into groups of 5, separated by spaces.

In the `decode` function, we do the same thing, but without grouping the characters into groups of 5.

atbash_cipher.py does not contain the *exact sequence* of HEAD lines you specified.
Try again.
DO NOT skip blank lines, comments, docstrings, etc!
The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in atbash_cipher.py with nothing missing!

atbash_cipher.py does not contain these 5 exact lines in a row:
```
def encode(plain_text):
    pass

def decode(ciphered_text):
    pass
```  
> 1642 prompt tokens, 351 completion tokens, $0.070320 cost  

I apologize for the confusion. I see that I made a mistake in the HEAD section of the edit block. The correct HEAD section should include the function definitions and the `pass` statements. Let's try again:

```python
atbash_cipher.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def encode(plain_text):
    pass


def decode(ciphered_text):
    pass
=======
import string

def encode(plain_text):
    plain_text = plain_text.lower()
    ciphered_text = ''
    for char in plain_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ciphered_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isnumeric():
            ciphered_text += char
    ciphered_text = ' '.join(ciphered_text[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(ciphered_text), 5))
    return ciphered_text

def decode(ciphered_text):
    plain_text = ''
    for char in ciphered_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            plain_text += chr(219 - ord(char))
        elif char.isnumeric():
            plain_text += char
    return plain_text
