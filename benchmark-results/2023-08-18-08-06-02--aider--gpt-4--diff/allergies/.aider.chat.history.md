#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.  
####   
#### An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).  
####   
#### The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:  
####   
#### - eggs (1)  
#### - peanuts (2)  
#### - shellfish (4)  
#### - strawberries (8)  
#### - tomatoes (16)  
#### - chocolate (32)  
#### - pollen (64)  
#### - cats (128)  
####   
#### So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.  
####   
#### Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:  
####   
#### - Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.  
#### - All the allergens Tom is allergic to.  
####   
#### Note: a given score may include allergens **not** listed above (i.e.  allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.).  
#### Your program should ignore those components of the score.  
#### For example, if the allergy score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: allergies.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the Allergies class, we need to modify the `allergies.py` file. 

The `__init__` method should store the score and calculate the allergies based on the score. 

The `allergic_to` method should check if the person is allergic to the given item.

The `lst` property should return a list of all allergies.

Here are the changes:

```python
allergies.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
class Allergies:

    def __init__(self, score):
        pass

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        pass

    @property
    def lst(self):
        pass
=======
class Allergies:
    ALLERGENS = {
        'eggs': 1,
        'peanuts': 2,
        'shellfish': 4,
        'strawberries': 8,
        'tomatoes': 16,
        'chocolate': 32,
        'pollen': 64,
        'cats': 128,
    }

    def __init__(self, score):
        self.score = score
        self.allergies = [allergen for allergen, value in self.ALLERGENS.items() if self.score & value]

    def allergic_to(self, item):
        return item in self.allergies

    @property
    def lst(self):
        return self.allergies
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses bitwise AND operation to check if a person is allergic to a specific item. If the bitwise AND of the score and the value of the allergen is not zero, it means the person is allergic to that item.
