#### # Introduction  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### Like the previous `Resistor Color Duo` and `Resistor Color Trio` exercises, you will be translating resistor color bands to human-readable labels.  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### - Each band acts as a digit of a number.  
####   For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
#### The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.  
#### The color bands are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - Black: 0  
#### - Brown: 1  
#### - Red: 2  
#### - Orange: 3  
#### - Yellow: 4  
#### - Green: 5  
#### - Blue: 6  
#### - Violet: 7  
#### - Grey: 8  
#### - White: 9  
####   
#### In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.  
#### For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.  
#### In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.  
#### Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.  
#### For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.  
####   
#### The tolerance band will have one of these values:  
####   
#### - Grey - 0.05%  
#### - Violet - 0.1%  
#### - Blue - 0.25%  
#### - Green - 0.5%  
#### - Brown - 1%  
#### - Red - 2%  
#### - Gold - 5%  
#### - Silver - 10%  
####   
#### The four-band resistor is built up like this:  
####   
#### | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |  
#### | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |  
#### | Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |  
####   
#### Meaning  
####   
#### - orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.  
#### - orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.  
####   
#### The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.  
####   
#### | Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |  
#### | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |  
#### | Value_1 | Value_2 | Value_3 | Multiplier | Tolerance |  
####   
#### Meaning  
####   
#### - orange-orange-orange-black-green would be 333 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.  
#### - orange-red-orange-blue-violet would be 323M ohms with a ±0.10 tolerance.  
####   
#### There are also one band resistors.  
#### One band resistors only have the color black with a value of 0.  
####   
#### This exercise is about translating the resistor band colors into a label:  
####   
#### "... ohms ...%"  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "black, green" should return:  
####   
#### "33 ohms ±0.5%"  
####   
#### When there are more than a thousand ohms, we say "kiloohms".  
####  That's similar to saying "kilometer" for 1000 meters, and "kilograms" for 1000 grams.  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", grey should return:  
####   
#### "33 kiloohms ±0.05%"  
####   
#### When there are more than a million ohms, we say "megaohms".  
####   
#### So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", "red" should return:  
####   
#### "33 megaohms ±2%"  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: resistor_color_expert.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To implement the functionality described in the instructions, we need to modify the `resistor_label` function in the `resistor_color_expert.py` file. 

The function should take a list of colors as input and return a string representing the resistance value and tolerance. 

We will need to create a dictionary to map the colors to their corresponding values and another one for the tolerance values. 

Then, depending on the number of colors given, we will calculate the resistance value and tolerance. 

Finally, we will format the output string according to the instructions.

Here is the proposed change:

```python
resistor_color_expert.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def resistor_label(colors):
    pass
=======
def resistor_label(colors):
    color_values = {
        'black': 0,
        'brown': 1,
        'red': 2,
        'orange': 3,
        'yellow': 4,
        'green': 5,
        'blue': 6,
        'violet': 7,
        'grey': 8,
        'white': 9
    }

    tolerance_values = {
        'grey': 0.05,
        'violet': 0.1,
        'blue': 0.25,
        'green': 0.5,
        'brown': 1,
        'red': 2,
        'gold': 5,
        'silver': 10
    }

    if len(colors) == 1:
        resistance = color_values[colors[0]]
        unit = 'ohms'
        tolerance = None
    elif len(colors) == 4:
        resistance = color_values[colors[0]] * 10 + color_values[colors[1]]
        resistance *= 10 ** color_values[colors[2]]
        tolerance = tolerance_values[colors[3]]
    elif len(colors) == 5:
        resistance = (color_values[colors[0]] * 100 +
                      color_values[colors[1]] * 10 +
                      color_values[colors[2]])
        resistance *= 10 ** color_values[colors[3]]
        tolerance = tolerance_values[colors[4]]

    if resistance >= 10**6:
        resistance /= 10**6
        unit = 'megaohms'
    elif resistance >= 10**3:
        resistance /= 10**3
        unit = 'kiloohms'
    else:
        unit = 'ohms'

    if tolerance is not None:
        return f"{resistance} {unit} ±{tolerance}%"
    else:
        return f"{resistance} {unit}"
>>>>>>> updated
```
This code will handle the conversion of resistor color bands to human-readable labels. It takes into account the different number of bands and the different units of resistance.

The test failures are due to the fact that the `resistor_label` function is returning a floating point number for the resistance value, even when it's an integer. The test cases expect an integer value when the resistance is a whole number.

To fix this, we need to modify the `resistor_label` function in the `resistor_color_expert.py` file to check if the resistance is an integer and, if so, convert it to an integer before returning it.

Here is the change we need to make:

```python
resistor_color_expert.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    if tolerance is not None:
        return f"{resistance} {unit} ±{tolerance}%"
    else:
        return f"{resistance} {unit}"
=======
    if resistance.is_integer():
        resistance = int(resistance)
    if tolerance is not None:
        return f"{resistance} {unit} ±{tolerance}%"
    else:
        return f"{resistance} {unit}"
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change checks if the resistance is an integer (i.e., has no decimal part) and, if so, converts it to an integer. This will remove the decimal part from the output string when the resistance is a whole number, which should make the function's output match the expected output in the test cases.
