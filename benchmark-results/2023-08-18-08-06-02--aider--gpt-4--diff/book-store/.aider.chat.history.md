#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) * $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) * $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) * $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book_store.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we need to implement the `total` function in the `book_store.py` file. This function should take a list of books as input and return the total cost after applying the maximum possible discount.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Count the number of each book in the basket.
2. Find all possible groupings of books that can be made from the basket.
3. For each grouping, calculate the total cost after applying the appropriate discount.
4. Return the minimum total cost from all the groupings.

Here is the code change needed:

```python
book_store.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def total(basket):
    pass
=======
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def total(basket):
    # Define the discounts
    discounts = {1: 1, 2: 0.95, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.75}
    
    # Count the number of each book in the basket
    counts = Counter(basket)
    
    # Find all possible groupings of books
    groupings = []
    for i in range(1, len(counts) + 1):
        for combination in combinations(counts, i):
            temp_counts = counts.copy()
            grouping = []
            for book in combination:
                temp_counts[book] -= 1
                grouping.append(book)
            groupings.append((grouping, temp_counts))
    
    # Calculate the total cost for each grouping
    costs = []
    for grouping, remaining_counts in groupings:
        cost = sum(discounts[len(grouping)] * 8 for book in grouping)
        remaining_books = [book for book, count in remaining_counts.items() for _ in range(count)]
        cost += total(remaining_books)
        costs.append(cost)
    
    # Return the minimum total cost
    return min(costs) if costs else 0
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the number of each book in the basket, and the `itertools.combinations` function to find all possible combinations of books that can be grouped together. It then calculates the total cost for each grouping by applying the appropriate discount for each group of books, and finally returns the minimum total cost.

The current implementation of the `total` function in `book_store.py` is inefficient because it tries to calculate the cost for all possible groupings of books, which can be a very large number for large baskets. This is likely causing the tests to time out.

We can improve the efficiency of the function by using a dynamic programming approach. Instead of calculating the cost for all possible groupings, we can calculate the cost for each possible number of distinct books in the basket, and then use these costs to calculate the cost for larger numbers of distinct books.

Here are the steps to implement this approach:

1. Initialize a list `costs` with a length of `len(basket) + 1`, and set `costs[0]` to 0. This list will store the minimum cost for each possible number of distinct books in the basket.

2. For each possible number of distinct books `i` from 1 to `len(basket)`, calculate the cost for each possible combination of `i` distinct books, and update `costs[i]` to the minimum of these costs.

3. Return `costs[len(basket)]` as the minimum total cost.

Here is the updated code for the `total` function:

```python
book_store.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def total(basket):
    # Define the discounts
    discounts = {1: 1, 2: 0.95, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.75}
    
    # Count the number of each book in the basket
    counts = Counter(basket)
    
    # Find all possible groupings of books
    groupings = []
    for i in range(1, len(counts) + 1):
        for combination in combinations(counts, i):
            temp_counts = counts.copy()
            grouping = []
            for book in combination:
                temp_counts[book] -= 1
                grouping.append(book)
            groupings.append((grouping, temp_counts))
    
    # Calculate the total cost for each grouping
    costs = []
    for grouping, remaining_counts in groupings:
        cost = sum(discounts[len(grouping)] * 8 for book in grouping)
        remaining_books = [book for book, count in remaining_counts.items() for _ in range(count)]
        cost += total(remaining_books)
        costs.append(cost)
    
    # Return the minimum total cost
    return min(costs) if costs else 0
=======
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def total(basket):
    # Define the discounts
    discounts = {1: 1, 2: 0.95, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.75}
    
    # Count the number of each book in the basket
    counts = Counter(basket)
    
    # Initialize the costs list
    costs = [0] * (len(basket) + 1)
    
    # Calculate the cost for each possible number of distinct books
    for i in range(1, len(basket) + 1):
        costs[i] = min(sum(discounts[len(combination)] * 8 for combination in combinations(counts, i)) + costs[len(basket) - i] for _ in range(i))
    
    # Return the minimum total cost
    return costs[len(basket)]
>>>>>>> updated
```

This updated code should be more efficient and should not cause the tests to time out.
