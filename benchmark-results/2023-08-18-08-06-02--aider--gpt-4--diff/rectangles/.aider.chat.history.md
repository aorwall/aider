#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.  
####   
#### ```text  
####    +--+  
####   ++  |  
#### +-++--+  
#### |  |  |  
#### +--+--+  
#### ```  
####   
#### The above diagram contains these 6 rectangles:  
####   
#### ```text  
####   
####   
#### +-----+  
#### |     |  
#### +-----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### ```text  
####    +--+  
####    |  |  
####    |  |  
####    |  |  
####    +--+  
#### ```  
####   
#### ```text  
####    +--+  
####    |  |  
####    +--+  
####   
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### ```text  
####   
####   
####    +--+  
####    |  |  
####    +--+  
#### ```  
####   
#### ```text  
####   
####   
#### +--+  
#### |  |  
#### +--+  
#### ```  
####   
#### ```text  
####   
####   ++  
####   ++  
####   
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of every line equals the length of the first line).  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rectangles.py  
#### Keep and implement the existing function or class stubs, they will be called from unit tests.  
#### Only use standard python libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

To solve this problem, we need to find all the possible rectangles in the given ASCII diagram. A rectangle is defined by its top left and bottom right corners. We can iterate over all possible pairs of points in the diagram and check if they form a rectangle.

Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Parse the input into a 2D array of characters.
2. Iterate over all pairs of points in the array.
3. For each pair of points, check if they form a rectangle.
4. If they do, increment a counter.
5. Return the counter.

We will need to modify the `rectangles.py` file.

Here is the updated code:

```python
rectangles.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
def rectangles(strings):
    pass
=======
def rectangles(strings):
    # Parse the input into a 2D array of characters
    grid = [list(row) for row in strings]

    # Initialize the counter
    count = 0

    # Iterate over all pairs of points in the array
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            for k in range(i + 1, len(grid)):
                for l in range(j + 1, len(grid[k])):
                    # Check if the current pair of points forms a rectangle
                    if grid[i][j] == '+' and grid[i][l] == '+' and grid[k][j] == '+' and grid[k][l] == '+':
                        # Check if all the sides of the rectangle are either '-' or '|'
                        if all(grid[i][m] in '+-' for m in range(j + 1, l)) and all(grid[k][m] in '+-' for m in range(j + 1, l)) and all(grid[n][j] in '+|' for n in range(i + 1, k)) and all(grid[n][l] in '+|' for n in range(i + 1, k)):
                            # If they do, increment the counter
                            count += 1

    # Return the counter
    return count
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code works by iterating over all possible pairs of points in the grid and checking if they form a rectangle. A pair of points forms a rectangle if the points are '+' and all the sides of the rectangle are either '-' or '|'. If a rectangle is found, the counter is incremented. The function returns the counter.
